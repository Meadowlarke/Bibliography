# Transcription

Finished presentation, a but over-long. I have 2300 words of notes to turn into a 2500 word paper next week.

## Commets from prof

Mke transcription longer. We talked about this as a longer piece, but what I turned in today was 5minutes. He would like to see me transcribe a longer portion of the cycle in some way (I think that this can be done with some demonstration of the differences between movements. Like find what is different between the cyces and find a way of notating that.)

Look into studies of white noise and brownian motion.  

Look into african water drumming.  

Look into studies of water sounds. 

# Messiaen

Analyzed barline length.  

Wrote about why it was signiicant.  

## To Do

Write explicit figured bass  

Figure out what is going on with the modes/octotonic, parhaps based on formal sections, i.e. what is the mode in A, in B, and in A'. 

Maybe read the Grove Music online article about this piece, if there is one, in order to present on the (incredible) context in which Messiaen was writing and performing this piece.
