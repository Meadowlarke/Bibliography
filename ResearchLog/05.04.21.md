# Messiaen

Reviewd presentaiton. I have enough material but I'm moving too fast.  

Notes from prof: Look more into the barlines. Why are some measures so long? How do they interact with the harmony? Like, what chords does he decide to place at the downbeats?

Also, he would like to see more about how I decided to write the figured bass and other reductions. What decsisions went into them, what affordances do they have?
