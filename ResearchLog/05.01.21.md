# Messiaen

Figured out the different modes used in the piece and how they interact.

Proposed systematic question about how Messiaen deals with conflicting systems.  
Wrote more notes on this idea about system conflict in music. 

Wrote notes on the cadential motion in the recapitulation.  

Figured out the "explicit figured bass."  

Figured out some other stuff going on where chords were written different than they sound.  

I now have about 2500 words of notes.  

## To do

Read about the context of this composition.  

Make outline from notes.
