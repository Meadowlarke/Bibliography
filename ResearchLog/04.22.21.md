# Messiaen analysis

Looked at the long tone and rhythms patterns, there werent that many, espescially not after the beginning.  

Started looking at chords in piano. Using figured bass is fun.

Taked to Chris. He told me to look at the pitch sets of both instruments combined, not just the violin.

Messian did a lot of things, not everyhting had isorhythm. This piece doesn't.

Chris suggets that I look into the simplicity of the chords, what is suggested by the sonoroties being so traidic while the violin is so odd? Does it suggest a certain key?

# Transcription

Read Ozcan "Basic Semantics of product sounds" and entered Znotes.

# Sesame Street

Read Ostrovsky 2012 "Talking Sesame to the Streets" and skimmed her other two works. Exluded her thesis from this survery.

Watched the Ma performances and took some fleeting notes. Need to be enteted into Zcasten.
