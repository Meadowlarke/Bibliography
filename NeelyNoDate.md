### Neely, Adam. "Music and White Supremacy" on Youtube. 2020. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr3quGh7pJA)

>**What we call music theory is part of the white, European, and male frame of reference. It is a racial ideology which stipulates the superiority of 18th century European musical styles.**

>Pt. 1: Neely substitutes the term "music theory" with "the musical style of 18th century classical musicians" to comic, yet provocative effect.

>Philip A. Ewell says "music theory is a racial ideology"

Discussion of figured bass/continuo and it's lack of relevance.

>"The white racial frame of music theory"

>Pt. 2: Neely suggests a sort of comparative musicology.

>Vicente Lusitano was a mixed race renaissance composer who famously debated Vicentino.

Robin James: "The epistemology of ignorance" which refers to the intentional separation of of analysis from culture. It is "the practice that materializes the commonsense intuition of the most privileged members of society as objective knowledge."

>Pt. 3: George Russel's "Lysidan chromatic concept"

>Discussion of the "Parameter complexes" of Halopana(?)

>Music theory has a perspective.

>Perspectives get lost in translation between different cultures. (Don't analyze western music with swara, or Indian music with our theory.)

>Pt. 4: Positivist/objectivist/empiricist music theorists try to make testable, mathematical observations about music to elevate theory.

>Pt. 5: Schenker

Shchenker theorizes that there is background, midground, and foreground structure. He looks for "deep structure" which he calls Ursatz. This is essentially mapping a V-I progression over an entire piece or section as a superstructure.

>Shcenker relies on figured bass, which is why we learn it in school.

>Schenker's music theory is racially motivated and a product of Hitler-era racial and ethnic tensions in Germany. He was an anti-Semitic Jew.
