### Taruskin, Richard."The Poietic Fallacy." _The Musical Times_ 145, no. 1886 (Spring 2004): 7-34.

**This piece is actually a book review of _Arnold Schoenberg's Journey_ by Allen Shawn,however Taruskin uses it as a platform to make much larger critiques of how we view Schoenberg and classical music. The problem which he points to is the "poietic fallacy"--the idea that the important part of the music is how brilliantly it is constructed, not its aesthetic qualities. He shows how this fallacy arises out of the historiography and philosophy of Franz Brendel. We know that Schoenberg saw himself as part of the Germanic chain of being on its way toward artistic perfection and Taruskin concludes that this outdated esthetic is precisely why Schoenberg is unpopular today.**
