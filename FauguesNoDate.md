### Faugues, Guillaume. _Miss le serviteur_


Faugues likes the texture where he starts with a duet and and then drops a glorious bass.

Kyrie, mm. 1-3: Clear quotation of the tenor line from model. Tenor=Tenor. Also direct quotation of the descant. The contraenors seem to be new material. i.e. he is writing on a two voice parody. Everything is at 4x the model.

Kyrie, mm. 3-: the tenor line now slows down to 8x speed of the model, but maintains the same melodic and rhythmic content as the song.

Kyrie, mm. 22-25: nice moment of imitation across the three low voices

Kyrie, mm 27: imitation in top two voices.

Gloria, mm.1: Begins, like the Kyrie, with a direct two voice parody of the song's descant and tenor.
