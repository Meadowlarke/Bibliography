# Holland, Agnieska. *Europa, Europa.* 1990.  

Begins with humming, then changes to the singing of the song for the circumscision.  

Shoe brushing blends out of the drums, bells are overlaid, bells are also heard in the next location, the kitchen, where they blend, pitch wise with the radio. At this point it is unclear whether the music is diagetic or not, until the mother and the daughter dance.  

#Z: This part of the film tas a lot of sonic continuity and trasnformations of the sources of theose sounds as real sounding objects.  

"And they made me a good communist" in voice-over cuts to them singing and marching. 

#Z: The voice over is an interesting element of this film. For one, it implies that he lives through all of this, but is also him telling us his story. It feels like we ar sitting down with this old guy as he tells us the incredible story of his life.   

Contrast to the waltz with hitler after death.  

#Z: What is happening in the dream sequences?

Oboe theme while locking door in bath barn.  

#Z: the oboe theme is used to suggest that something is afoot. It appears in the barn bath scene where Robert assaults him and discovers that he is a jew, and later when he is first kissing Leni.  

#Z: Whereas the oponning hilighted continuity, the middle section hilights contrast. The scene where Joseph and Robert are playing in the snow cuts to bombs falling.  

The phrenology tools sound so menacing.   

Ending with the same song, maybe.
