#### Chapt 15: The Cantus Firmus in Masses

**This chapter is an analysis of Dufay's _Sa la face ay pale_ mass which is based on chanson of his own authorship. This chapter analyzes this choice. It concludes that there is no reason to associate this mass with his time at the Savoy court.**

194: Se la face ay pale

195: Strangeness of his choice to reuse this chanson.

196: Discussion of why he would have chosen said chanson.

197: Analysis of sa la face ay pale and its play with mensural elements.

201: Conclusions about the Savoy years.


### Fallows, David. "The Last Agnus Dei or: The Cyclic Mass, 1450-1600, as forme fixe." in Polyphone Messen im 15. und 16. Jahrhundert ed. Andrea Ammendola, Daniel Glowotz, and JÃ¼rgen Heidrich. V&R Unipress.

**In short, this book chapter makes three arguments: That the Mass is a forme fixe, that its fixed characteristics were not liturgical but musical, and that composers saw the mass cycle "symphonically" that is, as a musical whole.**

53: Fixed forms: rondeu, virelai, and ballade.

54: The Mass is the most fixed form of them all.

54: Kyrie (three parts)(not nine, as you would expect liturgically.)

55: Gloria.

56: Credo.

57: Sanctus, the most musically free section 

57: Agnus Dei.

58: Masses in the Renaissance tended to be monothematic.

59: Idea that Masses were thought of symphonically.

59: Also, what is going on here? He's talking about how pieces are performed, but I don't quite get it.

62: Misa _La sol re fa mi_
