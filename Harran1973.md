26: Background on the composers and theorists.

II

32: Lanfranco rules for text underlay.  

#Z: According to Lanfranco, in plainchant, the words are grouped into meaningful syntactical units, whereas in menstural music the words are grouped according to the considerations of the counterpoint and the necessity of having rests.  

33: Music and syntax.  
 
34: Who the diffrent theorists were writing for.  

35: #Z: Lanfranco writes that every seperate note larger than the semi-minum gets its own syllable. Zarlino's account of the matter concurs. According to Lanfranco, notes in ligatures do not get their own syllables.  

37: Lanfranco on medial notes.  

38: Ligatures.  

-: #Z: Both Zarlino and Lanfranco write that ligatures get only one syllable.  

39: Dots.  

40: Semiminums after dotted minums.  

-: #Z: In rare cases, the semiminum after a dotted minum recieves tis own syllable.  

41: Small values after a dot.  

-: #Z: According to Lanfranco, only the initial semiminum in a series gets its own syllable. The white note at the end of the string is also without its own syllable. This is not the case for French chansons.  

43: Word repetitons.  

-: #Z: Both Zarlino and Lanfranco write that while repetiton of words of phrases is not allowe in plainchant, it is acceptable in menusural music so long as it fits. Zarlino gives more detail and stresses that when repeating text, only full phrases or sentences are worthy candidates and ther are best repeated in ways which ephasize their meaning.   

44: Ending a phrase.  

-: #Z: Lanfranco writes that if the piece has more notes than syllables, the pentultimate syllable is te be held out over the remaining notes untill one reaches the cadence, which recieves the final syllable. Zarlino adds to this that the pentultimate syllable must be accented.  

45: The last note.
