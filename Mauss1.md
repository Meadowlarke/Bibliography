### Mauss, Marcel. 1973\[1935\]. “Techniques of the Body.” Translated by Ben Brewster. _Economy and Society_ 2 (1): 70–87.

**In this essay, Mauss looks at the body as an object of culture. This term "techniques of the body" simply refers to the way that people in different societies learn to use their bodies. He gives the example that Price Curt Sachs joked that he could spot the gait of a Frenchman or Englishman from some distance. In this piece he spends a good bit of time listing and classifying different techniques of the body and ultimately concludes that it is thanks to society that these ways of using the body exist, and not vice versa.**
