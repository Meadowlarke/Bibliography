# Illich, Ivan. _Deschooling Society_ Hasbro, 1970.  

## Introduction

2: Acknowledgments and basic ideas.   

3: The affect of schooling.  

-: Modernization of poverty.  

-: Poverty defined in contradistinction to the advertised ideal of consumption. #Z: Poverty is defined by the affluent in contradistinction to their advertised ideal of consumption.   

4: Criticism of Title One (and the attitude that education can be improved by pumping in more money.)

5: #Z: Poor students will always fall behind more wealthy students even given the same schooling, as the wealthy student has the benefits of the casual education which takes place outside of school and includes books, conversations, travel, and a different sense of oneself and their possibilities due to their privilege.  

-: The "school age" of directed societal development.

6: Polarization of society by obligatory schooling.  

-: The "escalation of school."  

7: Social rank and schooling.  

-: #Z: Laws must be passed which prohibit discrimination based on prior schooling.  

-: #Z: Most learning happens casually, as a result of interest or circumstance. It is an illusion that most learning happens in school.  

7: The importance and benefit of planned instruction.  

8: Educational "credit card" proposal.  

-: Scarcity and certification.  

-: Experiments with teenagers teaching peers in Puerto Rico.  

9: #Z: Ivan Illich draws a clear line between education and acquiring skill.  

-: Meeting partners for educational (not skill acquisition) purposes.  

10: Paulo Freire teaching literacy to adults using politically charged words.  

-: Computer system for educational match making, proposal.  

-: #Z: Matching reading partners by title is radically different than the ideas behind "Great Books" clubs where the book selection is chosen by, as Illich puts it "some Chicago Professors." Matching reading parters by title of the work they want to discuss is rather more like Plato's dialogues and also allows the students to choose any book for further analysis.   

11: More on his proposed computer system.  

-: Incidental education and the modern world.
