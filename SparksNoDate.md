### Sparks, Edgar. _Cantus Firmus in Mass and Motet: 1420–1520_. New York: Da Capo Press, 1975.

**This book is first and foremost concerned with collecting facts regarding the use of cantus firmi (c.f.) in the renaissance. Until the time of this survey, there had been very little written which systematically investigated how c.f. were actually used in their time. This being an expository book, he saves his criticism regarding how other researchers have analyzed c.f. for the appendix. Sparks presents this book as a tool for better analyzing music of this time period. He argues that the c.f. must be understood in a much broader sense than we understand it today. In its time, it referred to any preexisting melody which is used as the basis of a new composition (not just a series of whole notes, conservative in motion). 3The melody line was not often copied literally, but was more often modified as per the needs of the composer. Pt. one of this book discusses the way that the c.f. was quoted and altered up until 1450. He presents two broad categories of c.f.: structural tenor and melodic paraphrase. It is not his intention to use these terms as systematic classifications, but rather as guiding principles for organization of discussion. He has also taken great pains to transcribe the scores, so please read them as part of the text.(1-4)**

**In this chapter, Sparks looks into the ways that c.f. were used in writing mass cycles. In short, c.f. were chosen because of their text, not their musical characteristics. Paraphrasing was used to bring the melody in line with melodic needs. There was little distinction made regarding the use of sacred or secular sources: sacred respect was expressed though the workmanship of the composer.**
