### Beethoven, Ludwig van. "Quartet no. 4." 

mm. 1: No introduction, we go right into the first theme.  

The first phrase is a sentence, with a two bar basic idea.  

mm. 7: Cm: |ii6 Gr+6 viio7/V V7|i6 ...| This is some kind of evaded cadence.

mm. 8: Four bar continuation, followed by a repetition of the continuation. This extends an eight-measure phrase to 12 bars.  

mm 13: PAC.  

mm: 42: Begin B theme, sentence structure, two-bar basic idea.
