### Maler, Anabel. "Musical Expression Among Deaf and Hearing Song Singers." In _The Oxford Handbook of Music and Disability Studies,_ edited by Neil William Lerner, Jopseph Nathan Strauss, Blake Howe, and Stephaie Jense-Moulton, 73-91. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016.   

Beginning from the generaly held, erronous cultural assumption that deafness is the antithesis to music making, Anabel Maler writes to deafness as a source of musical ability. Defness, she argues, does not preclude one from musical experience and production, but rather engenders musical ability. Maler describes a four part typology of the four primary types of song-signing perfromance: Live music interpretation services, live performances by song-signing artists, videos featuring original compositions, and those faturing the performance of "covers" or translations of musical works from outside of the deaf community. Maler shows how the styles among hearing and deaf song-signers are divergent. Hearing signers tend to see their performances as accesibilty tools to allow the deaf to appreciate music. Deaf signers, on the other hand, tend to see the visual performance as a space to create a visual and kinetic form of music.

I am largely unfamiliar with the deaf community and I found the two chapters from the edited volume quite eye opening. As far as the Maler chapter, I the examples she chose illustrative of her arguments and productive to read closely. In this conclusion of her chapter, Maler posits that "hearing can even be seen as a disability in the context of Deaf musical performance." This gives me pause, and makes me question the definiton of disability I was reading these chapters with. This feels like a little bit of a throw-away line and maybe I shouldn't take it too seriously, but it implies that disability is in fact just a state of non-normativity. The hearing body is non-normative to the deaf community and so is unable to participate in deaf music making---I definition that I can get behind. What do others make of this statement?

In ending this chapter, Maler suggests that hearing could be seen as a disability
