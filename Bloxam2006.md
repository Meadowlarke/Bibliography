### Bloxam, M. Jennifer. "'I have never seen your equal': Agricola, the Virgin, and the Creed." _Early Music_ 34, no. 3 (2006): 391-407.  

Bloxam uses the story of the singing white hart at the feast of the pheasent to point to the  emphatic spiritual content of the chanson _Je ne vis onques la pareille_. This is apparent 1) by its appearance at this fest on the cusp of Crusade, and 2) because it was sung in duet between a boy and a white hart---a symbol of Jesus Christ. Bloxam then tracks the proliferation of the line _Je ne vis onques la pareille_---I have never seen your equal---through numerous other poems of the time. Bloxam srgues that this line shows how this secular poetry was in fact simultaneously engaged in spiritual desire and devotion for the Virgin Mary. This, in turn, made it relatively easy for composers to turn this chanson for T-mass material. The remainder of this paper is an alaysis of Agricola's use of this chanson in sacred writing, and how he musically highlihghts the Marian elements in two Credo settings.
