### Introduction  

3: The medical establishment as a threat to health.  

4: Summary of argument of book.  

5: His use of footnotes against academia.  

6: Why the recovery from iatrogenic disease must be a poliitical task, not a professional one. 

7: "Health."  

8: Iatrogenesis as *specific counterproductivity.*   

-: "Medicalization of life."  

9: Why a professional health-care system is sickening.  

## Part I: Clinical Iatrogenesiso

### Chapter 1: The Epidemics of Modern Medicine  

13: The lack of relationship between medical progress and health.  

14: *Iatrogenic* illness.  

15: The illusion of doctor's effectiveness.  

16: Pandemics.  

17: The decline of old epidemics, the emergence of the new.  

20: Modern techniques, effective when made part of the culture.  

21: The ineffeicacy of doctors.  

#Z: On the inefficacy of doctors, Illich writes: "The fact that the doctor population is higher where certain diseases have become rare has little do do with the doctors' ability to control of eliminate them. It simply means that doctors deploy themselves as they like, more so than other professionals, and that they tend to gather where the climate is healthy, where the water is clean, and where people are employed and can pay for their services." Doctors don't cure disease, they just tend to live in palces with higher income and better sanitation.   

23: The questionable effeicacy of medical intervention for preventing infectious disease.  

24: and for noninfectious diesease. 

26: Doctor-inlficted injuries.  

27: The dangers of increasingly powerful medications.  

29: Dangerous treatment for non-existent diseases.  

-: Negligence by doctors.  

31: Malpractice claims.  

-: The high rate of accidents in hospitals.  

#Z: When Illich was writing in the 70s, the frequency of accidentes reported in hospitals was higher in all industries except mines and high-rise construction. The United States Department of Health calcultaed that 7% of all patients suffer compensable injuries while hospitalizes, though few of them seek compensation.  

33: Societies encouragment to be a consumer of medical treatment.  

-: *Social-* and *cultural- iatrogenesis.*  

34: *Medical nemesis.*  

## Part II: Social Iatrogenesis  

### Chapter 2: The Medicalization of Life  

39: The shift away from medicine which enhanced what occurs in nature.  

40: *Social iatrogenesis.*  

41: Medical monopoly and radical monopolies.  

43: Medical diagnoses as defense mechanisms for the industrial system.  

#Z: Medical diagnoses serve as means to turn political complaints against the stress and opression of life under capitalism into a demand for more expensive, industrailly-derived therapies which uphold the status quo.   

45: Medicine as moral enterprise.  

#Z: Medicine determines whether or not one persons suffering is valid. It decides what is normal, proper, or desirable. Medicine is a moral enterprise.   

47: Medical profession as manifestation of class power.  

48: The cost of medicine.  

50: Rising costs of care.  

51: Deceases in life expectancy.  

52: Isurance coverage encouraging expensive products.  

53: The problems with capitation based payment.  

54: Medicine in the Soviet Union.  

56: The use of public health funding for treatment, rather than sanitation in poor contries.  

58: Conspicuous therapies.  

-: The deprofessionalization of medicine in China---"barefoot medicine".  

59: The decline of barefoot medicine.  

61: Medicine upholding consumer society.  

63: Parmeceuticals and the body as machine.  

64: The marketing and sale of new drugs.  

65: "Consult a doctor" warning on bottles, rather than directions or instructions.  

-: The debasement of the doctor as a perscription dispenser.  

-: The over-perscribing of coloamphenicol.

67: Exposure of medical drug kabals in the 60s.  

68: Chile's president Dr. Salvador Allende.  

69: The overconsumption of drugs in the affluent world.  

71: Perscription drugs as commodities chosen by someone else.  

72: The lack of correlation between commercial promotion and the use of drugs.  

73: The problem with blaming the drug industry for drug addiction; the belief in technolgical health care.   

#Z: The overconsumption of drugs in both affluent and poor contries is not the result of advertisement by the drug industry, but rather a cultural belief that technology can be used to change the human condition however we please.  

74: Asprin and the new age of drugs.  

75: The end of great discoveries in pharmacology.  

76: The medical subdivision of people.  

78: Problematizing lifelong medical supervision.  

79: Reducing life to a "span."  

81: Pathologizing old age.  

82: The inability to raise life expectancy.  

-: The ways that the elderly are marginalized by institutions.  

85: Childhood death; taboo.  

-: Infant mortality. 

86: Breastfeeding.  

89: The medicalization of prevention.  

90: Descrimintation based on illness.  

91: Debunking the efficacy of perodica health examinations.  

93: Diagnostic bias in favor of sickness; tonsilitis example.  

94: Diagnostic inaccuracy.  

97: The production of life expectancy as a commodity.  

97: Terminal patients.  

98: The power that doctors get from this situation.  

100: Hospital death is now endemic.  

101: The increasing costs of dying.  

104: The cultural assumption that hospitalization will extend the life of the elderly.  

-: Terminal cancer patients.  

105: Increased death due to hospital "worship."  

106: The inefficacy of cardiac inensive-care units.  

107: Healing through ceremonies.  

108: "Placebos."

#Z: The term "placebo" was invented to distinguish the doctor's role as a magician from their role as an engineer, and to save them from being labeled a quack.  

-: Religeous acceptance of suffering.  

109: The gnostic world-view.  

110: The ethical fucntion of medecine.  

111: The monopolization of health care in to 20th C.

#: Physicians of the 20th century were the first occupation to monopolize healthcare.  

112: Tonsillectomy and the symbolic, non-technical roles of the modern doctor.  

113: The medical spectacle of Dr. Christiaan Barnard's pulbic heart surgeries.  

-: The use of life-extending equipment by Brazilian police in the torture of prisioners.  

114: High-tech medicine becomming black magic.  

-: Social iatrogenesis.  

115: Moral degradation via biomedical treatment rather than social acceptance.  

#Z: "Medical procedures multiply diesase by *moral degradation* when they isolate the sick in a professional environment rather than providing society with the motives and dsiciplines that increase social tolerance for the troubled." That is, social iatrogeneisis comes about from the isolation of the patient in a proessional environment where they are seperated from their own health and treated like organic machines to be cured though esoteric technological means, rather than by providing society with the tools to ease the suffering of those whose bodies diverge from our current perceptions of "health" and normalcy.  

116: Medical miriacles.   

-: The "medical fifedom" of over-diagnosis; deputization by police, teachers, etc. 

#Z: When modern medicine labels more people sick than it can handle, it turns over the low-prestiege management of the ill to the lower authorities that are the police and teachers. While medicine diagnoses them, the task of "treating" them is left to these authorities. Medicine defines addiction, but it is the police who are supposed to know how it shold be controlled.  

117: Non-medical theraputic fields: the multiplication of jobs which refelct the medical prestige.  

-: Deviance, Western vs. non-western societies.  

118: Disease is socially constructed.  

#Z: Disease is socially constructed. Each civilization difines it's own diseases and its responses to them.  

119: Parson's "sick role."  

123: Using sickness to avoid work.  

## Part III: Cultural Iatrogenesis  

### Intorduction  

127: Cultural iatrogenesis.  

#Z: Clinical iatrogenesis is when the natural processes of the body to cope and heal are replaced by management my the medical establishment. Social iatrogenesis occurs when people are deprived from the conditions that allow them to control their own internal states and the internal states of their freinds, family, and community. Cultural iatrogenesis arises when the medical establisment "saps the will of the people to suffer their reality," that is, it removes and replaces our natural ability as individuals to live thorough suffering, and our natural tendencies as communites to care for the suffering.  

128: "The art of suffering."  

129: Health as social performance.  

132: Medical civilization destroying the art art of suffering.   

#Z: The goal of the medical establishemnt and the civilization that surrounds it to destroy pain and suffering along with the need for an art of suffering and dying. Suffering, healing, and dying are fundamental aspects of human life, that culture previously taught us how to do, have been replaced by tehnocracy, which is in opposition to every single cultural health progam that it encouters in its mission of progressive colonization.  

### Chapter 3: The Killing of Pain  

133: Pain.  

#Z: Culture has historically given context and meaning to pain, and the performance of *suffering* by which it is experienced and interpreted. Medical civilization turns pain into a technical matter to be cured, thus depriving the sufferer of its meaing. However, it is culutre that makes pain tolerable by interpreting it as a necessity and placing it into a meaningful setting---it is only pain that is perceived as curable that we find intolerable. 

136: Factors that influence the experience of pain.  

#Z: There are at least four functional factors other than the nature of the pain stimulus that effect its intensity: culture, anxiety, attention and interpretation.  

137: The objectification and quantization of pain by the medical establishment.  

138: Impediments to studying the history of pain.  

140: How we are alone in our pain.  

142: Pain as a question.  

#Z: Pain weather experieced by the self, or observed in others, can be understood as a question. It asks What is wrong? How much longer? Why must I/ought I/should I/ can I suffer? Why does this evil exist and why does it strike me?

143: The reduction of pain from question to discomfort. 

144: How culture transforms pain into personal experience: words, dugs, myths, and models.   

#Z: Culture provides at least four interrelated subprograms for the transformation of bodiliy pain into personal experience: words, drugs, myths, and models. Pain in shaped by culture into a question that can be expressed in words, cries, groans, and gestrues. Each culture has its pharmacpoia of substances for pain relief and to ease the emotions. Each culture has its explation that expain the reson for the pain, whether that is the muslim Kimset or the Hindu Karma. And finally, each culture has its narrative models for how pain is best suffered.   

145:

#Z: Medicalization deprives us of skill in the art of suffering.  

146: The modern emphasis on treatment, not healing.  

147: The lack of an origin of modern pain in ancient Eurasan culture.  

148: Pain as cosnic evil in medeterranean postcalssical culture.  

#Z: Pain as the bitter expereince of cosmic evil is a dsitinctive and unifying characteristic of Medeterranean postclassical cultures which lasted until the 17th century. The belief that pain was better not suffered, but alleviated by a priest, physican, or politician, was unthinkable, as pain was the experience of a marred universe, was a sign of corruption in nature that humans were themselves a part of---to do away with pain would be to do away with the patient---and finally, pain was an unmediated experience of evil, there was and could be no distinction between the source of pain the the pain that was suffered.   

149: Why the killing of pain was unthinkable in premodern Europe.  

150: Descartes and the mechanization of the body and pain.   

152: Substitutes for human experience in anesthetetic society.  

153: The effects of pain on a society where it has been medically expropriated.  

#Z: The medicalized expropration of pain has replaced dignified suffering with artifically prolonged, opaque, depersonalized maintenance. Pain killing, rather than engaging with culturally mediated forms of managing suffering leads to numb self-observation of the inevitable process of decay. "Increasingly, pain-killing turns people into unfeeling spectators of their own decaying selves."

### Chapter 4: The Invention and Elimiation of Disease

155: Health care during the French Revolution.  

159: Medicine after the Congress of Vienna.  

#Z: In the mid-nineteenth century, there was a saying that was attributed to Hippocrates and was still quoted with approval: "You can discover now weight, no form, nor calculation to which to refer your judgement of health and sickness."

160: The origins of the measurement of health and disease.  

162: The origins of the "bedside" clinic.  

164: State authority and universal standards.  

166: Solution: The demedicaliztion of the concept of disease.  

#Z: Illich proposes we end our current health crisis through changes in our epistemology. We must clarify the logical status and social nature of diagnosis and therapy. He suggests a critical and scientifically sound demedicalization of the concept of disease.   

167: Metal illness and the similar immateriality of "physical illness".  

#Z: Mental illness can only be described within an ideological framework, the consistancy of which is based on the social prejudices of the pyschiatrist. The pyschiatrist acts as an agent of social, ethical, and plitical norms.  

169: Medical diagnosis as mask for a broken society.  

#Z: Medical diagnosis is a convenent mask for the medical establishment to explain away a body's rebellion agains the demands of industrial society, and in a way that encourages the consumption and production of more industrial goods such as pharmeceuticals. Instead of calling out their peers for creating a world in which humans cannot live, physiscans---members of the ruling class---judge the victim as deviant and diseased. 

-: The naming of diesease.  

#Z: Describing children as having a "learning disability" serves as an alabi for a school's intolerance or incompetence. 

170: Linguistic mystification.  

171: Folk language of disease.  

#Z: The increasing use of medical terms in common speech make disease into an insstrument of class domination. The educated perform class by speaking in medical jargon, which has even become necessary for some social acceptible speech---"belly button" and "middle" sound infantile compared to "naval" and "torso." In this way the educated become collegues of the doctor in treatment, while the opressed are put in their place as subjects who do not speak the langague of the ruling class.  

172: The effectiveness of cheap and simple medicine.  

### Chapter 5: Death against Death  

174: Societal images of death.  

175: The image of "natural death."  

#Z: The ideal of a "natural death" where people die in good health under medical care at an old age is a relativly new idea, which has come at the end of 500 years of change from death as God's call, to the the Renaissance "dance of the dead," to our modern death under intense medical care.        

176: The Dance of the Dead.  

179: The origins of Death the mythical character in the 1500s.  

181: Clocks and Death.  

183: *Ars Moriendi,* a 15th century guide to dying.  

#Z: The *Ars Moriendi* was one of the first printed do-it-yourslef books and was a best seller for about 200 years. It was guide to dying for common folk, writtenin the late 1400s.  

187: The objectification of the human via new ideas of death.  

-: The former legal standing of the dead.  

188: Historical dissections.  

189: Bourgeois death.  

190: The rich prolonging life.  

192: New myths of the social value of the old.  

194: Aestheticising chronic illness in the 1700s.   

-: The Enlightenment and new power over death attributed to the doctor.  

196: The military origins of the "country doctor."  

197: "Natrual death" at the beginning of the 20th century.    

199: The changing relationship to death in iconography.  

201: Death under intensive care.  

202: Death and apocalype.  

204: The imperialism of hopsitalized medicine.  

206: Medicalized death and consumerism.  

## Part IV: The Politics of Health

### Chapter 6: Specific Counterproductivity  

212: Negative externalities.  

-: Counterproductivity.  

#Z: Counterproductivity is when the use of an instution, such as schools, "the market," or hospitals makes it hard for decentralized society to provide those things that the institution provides. These are not externalities, but rather "built in social frustration[s]" that bar or miseducate us in our own self fulfilment. Humans learn naturally, but school teaches us that we only learn in certain ways, and that only certain things are valuable. Counterproductivity of the market conditions us *to get* things rather than *to do* them. We are expected to buy a new one rather than to repair the old one. We are expected to buy one rather than to make one ourselves using local materials. (see local ingredients, simply cooked.) We are expected to buy commodified heath practices, procedures, and products rather than leaning how to heal ourselves and others.   

214: Comodification of health.  

#Z: Healthcare in industrial society renders health a comodity, designed and sold to others, not made by them or with their communities.  

215: Autonomous production.  

-: Effective industrialized tools.  

217: Those made most powerless by conterproductive institutionalization.  

#Z: Those made most powerless by conterproductive institutionalization are not the poor, who tend to exist on the margins of these systems, but rather the affluent who can pay for the new staples that the institutions promise and thus lose their autonomy.   

219: The pathologization of old age and the creation of poverty.  

### Chapter 7: Political Countermeasures  

221: The British National Health Service and hypochondria.
