# Illich, Ivan. *Medical Nesesis: The Expropriation of Health.* New York: Pantheon Books, 1976.  

### Introduction  

3: The medical establishment as a threat to health.  

4: Summary of argument of book.  

5: His use of footnotes against academia.  

#Z: In *Medical Nemesis,* Illich provides very verbose footnotes to serve as a bibliographic guide to laypeople and outsiders to the materials which he is citing. He sees this as a way to beak academia's monopoly on information though the way which it creates conversations which are hard for outsiders to enter. 

6: Why the recovery from iatrogenic disease must be a poliitical task, not a professional one. 

7: "Health."  

8: Iatrogenesis as *specific counterproductivity.*   

-: "Medicalization of life."  

9: Why a professional health-care system is sickening.  

## Part I: Clinical Iatrogenesiso

### Chapter 1: The Epidemics of Modern Medicine  

13: The lack of relationship between medical progress and health.  

14: *Iatrogenic* illness.  

15: The illusion of doctor's effectiveness.  

16: Pandemics.  

#Z: While the end of the great pandemics of the 19th and 20th centuries is often attributed to medical therapies, most of the decreases in fatality came from improved nutrition, housing, and a decrease in the cirulence of the infections. For example, the combined death rate of scarlet fever, diphteria, whooping cough, and measles among children 15 and under shows that 90% of the total decline in mortality between 1860 and 1965 occured *before* the introduction of antibiotics and widespread immunizations. No matter how much or how little medical care there is available, diarreah and upper-reperatory-tract infections last longer and occur more frequently in poor and mal nourished countries than in wealthier contries.  

17: The decline of old epidemics, the emergence of the new.  

#Z: The environment is the primary determinant of the state of general health of any population, not access to medical care.  

20: Modern techniques, effective when made part of the culture.  

21: The ineffeicacy of doctors.  

#Z: On the inefficacy of doctors, Illich writes: "The fact that the doctor population is higher where certain diseases have become rare has little do do with the doctors' ability to control of eliminate them. It simply means that doctors deploy themselves as they like, more so than other professionals, and that they tend to gather where the climate is healthy, where the water is clean, and where people are employed and can pay for their services." Doctors don't cure disease, they just tend to live in palces with higher income and better sanitation.   

23: The questionable effeicacy of medical intervention for preventing infectious disease.  

24: and for noninfectious diesease. 

26: Doctor-inlficted injuries.  

27: The dangers of increasingly powerful medications.  

29: Dangerous treatment for non-existent diseases.  

-: Negligence by doctors.  

31: Malpractice claims.  

-: The high rate of accidents in hospitals.  

#Z: When Illich was writing in the 70s, the frequency of accidentes reported in hospitals was higher in all industries except mines and high-rise construction. The United States Department of Health calcultaed that 7% of all patients suffer compensable injuries while hospitalizes, though few of them seek compensation.  

33: Societies encouragment to be a consumer of medical treatment.  

-: *Social-* and *cultural- iatrogenesis.*  

34: *Medical nemesis.*  

## Part II: Social Iatrogenesis  

### Chapter 2: The Medicalization of Life  

39: The shift away from medicine which enhanced what occurs in nature.  

40: *Social iatrogenesis.*  

41: Medical monopoly and radical monopolies.  

43: Medical diagnoses as defense mechanisms for the industrial system.  

#Z: Medical diagnoses serve as means to turn political complaints against the stress and opression of life under capitalism into a demand for more expensive, industrailly-derived therapies which uphold the status quo.   

45: Medicine as moral enterprise.  

#Z: Medicine determines whether or not one persons suffering is valid. It decides what is normal, proper, or desirable. Medicine is a moral enterprise.   

47: Medical profession as manifestation of class power.  

48: The cost of medicine.  

50: Rising costs of care.  

51: Deceases in life expectancy.  

52: Isurance coverage encouraging expensive products.  

53: The problems with capitation based payment.  

54: Medicine in the Soviet Union.  

56: The use of public health funding for treatment, rather than sanitation in poor contries.  

58: Conspicuous therapies.  

-: The deprofessionalization of medicine in China---"barefoot medicine".  

59: The decline of barefoot medicine.  

61: Medicine upholding consumer society.  

63: Parmeceuticals and the body as machine.  

64: The marketing and sale of new drugs.  

65: "Consult a doctor" warning on bottles, rather than directions or instructions.  

-: The debasement of the doctor as a perscription dispenser.  

-: The over-perscribing of coloamphenicol.

67: Exposure of medical drug kabals in the 60s.  

68: Chile's president Dr. Salvador Allende.  

69: The overconsumption of drugs in the affluent world.  

71: Perscription drugs as commodities chosen by someone else.  

72: The lack of correlation between commercial promotion and the use of drugs.  

73: The problem with blaming the drug industry for drug addiction; the belief in technolgical health care.   

#Z: The overconsumption of drugs in both affluent and poor contries is not the result of advertisement by the drug industry, but rather a cultural belief that technology can be used to change the human condition however we please.  

74: Asprin and the new age of drugs.  

75: The end of great discoveries in pharmacology.  

76: The medical subdivision of people.  

78: Problematizing lifelong medical supervision.  

79: Reducing life to a "span."  

81: Pathologizing old age.  

82: The inability to raise life expectancy.  

-: The ways that the elderly are marginalized by institutions.  

85: Childhood death; taboo.  

-: Infant mortality. 

86: Breastfeeding.  

89: The medicalization of prevention.  

90: Descrimintation based on illness.  

91: Debunking the efficacy of perodica health examinations.  

93: Diagnostic bias in favor of sickness; tonsilitis example.  

94: Diagnostic inaccuracy.  

97: The production of life expectancy as a commodity.  

97: Terminal patients.  

98: The power that doctors get from this situation.  

100: Hospital death is now endemic.  

101: The increasing costs of dying.  

104: The cultural assumption that hospitalization will extend the life of the elderly.  

-: Terminal cancer patients.  

105: Increased death due to hospital "worship."  

106: The inefficacy of cardiac inensive-care units.  

107: Healing through ceremonies.  

108: "Placebos."

#Z: The term "placebo" was invented to distinguish the doctor's role as a magician from their role as an engineer, and to save them from being labeled a quack.  

-: Religeous acceptance of suffering.  

109: The gnostic world-view.  

110: The ethical fucntion of medecine.  

111: The monopolization of health care in to 20th C.

#: Physicians of the 20th century were the first occupation to monopolize healthcare.  

112: Tonsillectomy and the symbolic, non-technical roles of the modern doctor.  

113: The medical spectacle of Dr. Christiaan Barnard's pulbic heart surgeries.  

-: The use of life-extending equipment by Brazilian police in the torture of prisioners.  

114: High-tech medicine becomming black magic.  

-: Social iatrogenesis.  

115: Moral degradation via biomedical treatment rather than social acceptance.  

#Z: "Medical procedures multiply diesase by *moral degradation* when they isolate the sick in a professional environment rather than providing society with the motives and dsiciplines that increase social tolerance for the troubled." That is, social iatrogeneisis comes about from the isolation of the patient in a proessional environment where they are seperated from their own health and treated like organic machines to be cured though esoteric technological means, rather than by providing society with the tools to ease the suffering of those whose bodies diverge from our current perceptions of "health" and normalcy.  

116: Medical miriacles.   

-: The "medical fifedom" of over-diagnosis; deputization by police, teachers, etc. 

#Z: When modern medicine labels more people sick than it can handle, it turns over the low-prestiege management of the ill to the lower authorities that are the police and teachers. While medicine diagnoses them, the task of "treating" them is left to these authorities. Medicine defines addiction, but it is the police who are supposed to know how it shold be controlled.  

117: Non-medical theraputic fields: the multiplication of jobs which refelct the medical prestige.  

-: Deviance, Western vs. non-western societies.  

118: Disease is socially constructed.  

#Z: Disease is socially constructed. Each civilization difines it's own diseases and its responses to them.  

119: Parson's "sick role."
