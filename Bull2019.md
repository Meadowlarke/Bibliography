## Chapter 1: Locating Classical Music in Culture.  

1: Summary of the chapter.  

2: Understanding social class.  

3: Expressing cultural capital.  

#Z: Bull theorizes "cultural capital" as any form of value that can be acquired through classical music practices. 

4: Producing the self.  

#Z: Cultural practices such as music are resources for producing the self.  
-: The middle class and the fear of falling.  

5: Characteristics of the middle class.   

-: Cultural distinctions as boundary drawing.  

6: The ethos of long-term dedicated practice which is seen in classical music means that those who are unwilling or unable to invest the time and resources are unable to participate in the production of classical music. This combined with the idea of "autonomous" art which positions classical music outside of social, political, and economic concerns creates a well disguised boundary which preserves middle class spaces.  

-: Intensive parenting.  

-: Concerted cultivation vs natural growth models of parenting.  

#Z: Annette Lareau describes American middle-class parenting as "concerted cultivation" in which children are seen as a project and a site of investment. In this model, children are made to accumulate skills, resources, and experiences which will shape the adult that they will become. The "natural growth" model which is more associated with working class families see the child as already whole and does not require any, say, extracurriculars to improve them as a person and prepare them for adulthood.   

-: Suzuki method.  

-: "Musical mothering."  

7: Musical ability as parental investment.  

#Z: Clare Hall says that ability in classical music can be understood from a Bourdieusian perspective as the investment by the musician's parent's and teachers in middle-class ideals.  

8: Gender norms.  

9: Respectable femininity and classical music.  

-: Race, gender, and stereotypes.  

10: Divisions among the middle class.  

11: How Bull divided her research participants.  

-: Instrument divisions among fractions of the middle class.  

13: Studying music as culture.  

#Z: Georgina Born argues that music is best understood as a kind of mediation between sonic, cultural, technological, and cultural elements rather than as an object.   

14: Historical moments of association between classical music and the middle classes.  

15: The "social aesthetic" of classical music.  

16: Classical music's mediation of the social.   

17: "Refracting social categories" and feeling like an outsider.  

18: Value.  

#Z: Lucy Green's research into British secondary school music education found that when classical music was taught is was done so in ways that engaged with its "inherent" musical qualities, while popular music was taught the focus was on its extra-musical qualities, which implicitly render it a musically inferior.  

19: Divide in interest between music in school and music out of school.  

#Z: Stahl, Burnard, and Perkins say that "individuals become agentic within fields where they feel they have value."
