154: Choosing the urban set.  

-: #Z: Inspired by a PSA on the urban life of children as part of the "Give a Damn" ad campaign by the New York Urban Coalition, Jon Stone decided that the show have an urban set. This came in part from the realization that "For a preschool child in Harlem, the street is where the action is. As often as not she is housebound all day while her mother works, aand, from the vantage point of her apartment, the sidewalk outside must look like Utopia. Outside there are kids hollering, jumping double Dutch, running through the open hydrants, playing stickball. Our set had to be an inner-city street, and more particularly it had to be a brownstone so that the cast and kids could 'stoop' in the age-old New York tradition, sitting on the front steps and watching the world go by." The set was modeled after the atual streets and builings of Harlem by set designer Charles Rosen. In particular, Stone wantd a movie style set, in all its detail, not the cardboard and canvas of childrens television at the time.  

155: #Z: Cooney was known for taking a hands-off approach to leadership. Stone recalls that when he presented her with his radical idea of modelling the set after Harlem she "said something to the effect that we were the  people she chose to create this program, and if this is how I saw it, so be it."
