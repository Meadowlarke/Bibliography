### Henriques, Julian. "The Vibrations of Affect and Their Propagation on a Night Out on Kingston's Dancehall Scene." _Body & Society_ 16, no. 1 (2010): 57-89.

**This paper is an attempt to find a materialist model for affect which is based in the propagation of vibration rather than the movement or circulation of particles or bodies. As a case study and source of inspiration, Henriques looks at the night life in Kingston Jamaica and the way in which sound is materialized and affect hypothesized. His model, basically, is that affect is transmitted as energy moving toward a more of less stagnant medium, as sound energy moves via compactions and rarefactions.**

58: Feeling and vibration

58: Vibrations as a materialist model of affect.

58: Transmission of affect is the energetic patterning of frequencies, not the circulation of objects nor the movements of bodies.

58: "Rhythms are material"

61: Cycles in the dancehall 

63: Bass culture

64: DJs "Perform the archive"

65-67: A section on waves and transmission (which I found to be largely speculative and misinformed.)

72: Sheets-Johnson: Feeling is the embodiment of movement.

75: Affect.

79: William Jones (We a sad because we cry, mad because we strike.)
