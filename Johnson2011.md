### Johnson, Nicholas, "Carolus Luython's _Missa super Basim: Caesar Vive_ and Hermetic Astrology in Ealy Seventeenth-Century Prague." _Musica Disciplina_ 56, (2011): 419-462.

>**In the early modern worldview, _music_ was a much broader category than it is to us moderns. _Music_ encompased elements of mathematics, astronomy, and human physiology. Scientists at this time, in this case Johannes Kepler, found it meaningful to relate the planetary aspects each to a musical interval. This paper looks at how Carolus Luython's _Missa super Basim: Caesar Vive_  seeks to aid his impoverished and beleaguered patron, Rudolf II, by writing a Mass which emulates his natal horoscope---the music of instruments being the human controlled analogue of the music of the spheres and able to create an actual effect on humanity.**
