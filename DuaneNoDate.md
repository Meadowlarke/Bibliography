### Duane, Ben. "Analysis 1." Class taught at Washington University in Saint Louis, Fall 2020.
#### Week 1

Spend lots of time analyzing the scores

Aug 6 chords

Sonata form

Schubert's "purple patch"

Schubert liked a three key structure, which functions much like the more common two key structure.

#### Week 2:

**Tuesday**

Minuet and trio forms.

Kinds of non-chord tones.

**Thursday**

Don Giovani, Il mio tesoro: The passage at 12 is a bit ambiguous. The g on the downbeat happens on a dom7 and doesn't sound like la. However, individual chords can evolve over time [David Lewin, "Music Theory Phenomenology and Modes of Perception."] That is what we have in this case. We are approaching by la and leaving by re. The phrase structure of this piece is very flexible and based on the text (phrase labels were invented for instrumental music). The new phrase at 19 is bracketed off by the sequence and key change. It has a small, nested sentence structure. It is lead into by the dissolution of energy via the triplets at 18.

The trick with modulations is to analyze in both keys and look for the moment when the chords stop making sense in the old key.:

Bb: I V7/V V42/V V6 vi6(weird) 

F: IV V7 V64 I6 ii6 V644-753 I

Sentence: Basic idea, basic idea, continuation, cadence. (Think Ludwig van Beethoven Symphony No. 5 in C minor, Op. 67 BUM BUM BUM BUM… BUM BUM BUM BUM… bum bum bum bum, bum bum bum bum...)

Period: Antecedent (a) and half cadence, consequent (a') and perfect authentic cadence.

Small ternary: a, b, a' (but often more varied)

Discussion of Caplin: Harmony unfolds in the bigger phrase more than moment to moment. He begins cadential progressions at the I6. Remember the sequences of the ascending V6 and descending 3rd (which sometimes alternates root and first inversion).


#### Week 3

**Tuesday**

The most important part of analysis is identifying phrases.

Brahms:

Hemioa vs. cross rhythm.

Lots of rhythmic conflict

a a' b a'' form

You can have an elided authentic cadence.

Hybrid phrase type: bi, ci, cont.

"Tonicized half cadence"

**Thursday**

Cook (on Schenker):

Schenker is going out of fashion for many reasons.

Reduction to most basic structural form is the number one goal.

Background, middleground, foreground.

What is the middlegound can be ambiguous.

Ersatz and earlymean.

Fundamental line: descending 3rd, 5th, or 8v to tonic.

Fundamental structure is two-part counterpoint, Ex: e, d, c over c, g, c harmonized I V I.

Predominants do not, strictly speaking, belong in the background.

"Unfolding" is basically arpeggiation to which you may add a dissonant passing tone or a neighbor.

Embellishments may themselves be embellished.

#### Week 4

Passing 64

Ascending 2nds in Mozart: 5-6 ascending V sequence + chromatic passing tones.

Sequences are more about pairs of chords than individuals.

**Thursday** 

<a name= "Duane, R4"></a>

Discussion of [Kerman, "How We Got into Analysis, and How to Get out."](#Kerman, Analysis)

Analysis vs criticism?

The field of music theory is pretending that it is doing something greater than it really is. It takes a scientistic approach which adds a veneer of objectivism to a fundamentally ideological and aesthetic pursuit. What has been called "analysis" is just another form of criticism. Shchenker was already subjective.

Instead, Kerman would like to see a willingness to involve aesthetic evaluations.

Kermans critique of the Schenker Graphs: The f natural at "klinger" is the emotional peak of the piece, but it is left out of the Schenker graph. Schenker also tends to have little to say about the text. 

#### Week 5:

**Tuesday**

Bach fantasia:

seq in bars 9-10: E-F to D-Eb

Schema theory

Evaded cadence mm 25.

Elided cadence mm 28.

Half cadence mm 33.

Dominant arrival.

**Thursday**

Caplin:

Formal function: you can hear the funciton, even without reading or listening to the whole piece. "At the needle drop."

Transitions sound like transitions no matter what.

Syntax and formal function (17)

Sentence and period structures and their functions.

#### Week 6

Mozart Symphony 40:

mm. 1: theme 1

mm. 44: Theme 2

Transition candidates: 20 and 28

Rothstein:

What is a phrase 

Rothstein is a Shenkerian. Phrase has a minddle ground aspect to it.

Hypermeter: Meter at the bar to bar level---strong and weak bars like strong and weak beats. It is not equal to phrase.

How can hypermeter be disruptive? Elisions.  

#### Week 7  

Tuesday:  

Dom-9 chords and their resolutions.  

Dom-13 chords.  

Thursday:  

You will always have tonic in an Aug6.  

Useage of Aug6 chords.  

#### Week 8  

Tuesday:  

Stability of keys in sonata forms.  

Thursday:  

Melodic motives.  

Mention of set theory.  

Ich grolle nicht.  

Harmonic continuity may restart at phrase boundary.  

#### Week 9:  

Neo-riemanian theory.

Cohn hyper-hexatonic system.

#### Week 10:

Minuet and Trio is a compound terary.   

Mozart K. 464.  

Fonte.  

Lament bassline.  

#### Week 13:

Medial ceasura.  

Discussion of Hepokoski and their two-part sonata exposition: P TR 'S (PAC)//C. 

EEC Essential expositional closure: PAC which ends the second theme.  

"Levels of defaults" for key areas.  

"Dominant lock."  

Dynamic of the medial ceasura.  

Tripple hammer blow.  

Occasion of #4 in buildup to MC.

Contiunuous exposition (no settling into second theme.)
