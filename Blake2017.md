### Blake, David. "Musicological Omnivory in the Neoliberal University." _The Journal of Musicology_ 34, no. 3 (2017): 319-353.  

**Basically, the argument here is that authors and neo-liberal institutions have been attacking a lack of diversity and so on which doesn't actually exist in contemporary musicology. In so doing, they paint musicology as a burdensom and hegemonic field. Blake argues that we should instead reframe musicology as ain inclusive field. What Blake is trying to show is that there is this norm in musicological research of omnivory. You are not being radical. Omniverous musicologists are not renegades, but rather just taking part in the omniverous turn.**
