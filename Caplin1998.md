#### Chapter 1

9: Form: the hierarchical arrangement of discrete, perceptually significant time spans---the grouping structure.

9: Sentence: 8 measure with a 2 measure basic idea containing several distinct motives. The presentation phrase has tonic harmony. The continuation is characterized by fragmentation and harmonic acceleration. The continuation moves with 1 bar harmonic units.

11: Liquidation

Continuation ends with a half cadence.

12: The period. mm 3-4 bring a contrasting idea (not a fragmented continuation). the basic idea returns at mm 5-6.

13: Small ternary: ABA'. A is exposition of period or sentence structure. B is standing on the dominant. B is not often composed as a conventional theme type. A' completes harmonic melodic processes left open at the end of B. It often eliminates some repetitions of A and has further development. It has a new contrasting idea.

16: Codetta/closing section.

16: "Standing on the dominant"

17: Sonata exposition.



#### Chapter 2: Fundamental Progressions

p.23: Short note on Hugo Riemann (functions vs scale degree)

23: Overview of scale-degree theory

24: IV --V vs II6 --V

24: Discussion of various pre-dominants

24: Prolonged, cadential, and sequential progressions.

25: Prolongational progressions: pedal point, neighbor chords, passing chords, substitute chords.

27: Cadential progressions: authentic, half (29), sequential: ascending and descending 2nds, 3rds, and 5ths.

#### Chapter 3

35: REal vs notated measures

37: Basic idea bounded by a rest

#### Chapter 13  

199: Eight-measure themes.
