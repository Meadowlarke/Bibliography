#Z: In order to convey that she is playing something very quietly, in concerts sometimes Evelyn Glennie will move her mallets, but not actually strike the notes. She says that ""If I want to play something quietly, sometimes I move my mallets but I'm not actually touching the instrument. So, the audience feels I'm playing extremely quietly, and they really do believe they're hearing something even though nothing is coming out. It's because they're seeing the movement [...] that automatically gives them the feeling that sound is there." This highlights the strong visual component in sonic perception that most people unconsciously and gives a glimpse into the listening practices that Glennie herself makes significant use of.  

#Z: Multimodal listening practices cultivate a sense of sound as an ecological event in which they are participating.

118: Multimodal listening as ongoing practice.   

#Z: Graham Pullin writes that "the best way to design the experience is to experience the design."

119: The limitations of digital composing environments.  

120: Summary.
