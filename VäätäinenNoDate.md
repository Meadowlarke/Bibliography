### Väätäinen, Hanna. 2017. “Forming Common Notions in a Kinetic Research Collaboration” 205–22. In _Musical Encounters with Deleuze and Guattari_, edited by Pirkko Moisala, Taru Leppänen, Milla Tiainen, and Hanna Väätäinen. Bloomsbury Sound Studies. New York: Bloomsbury Academic.

**This chapter details a series collaborative dance sessions by Väätäinen and Anneli Tiilikainen while viewing the film _Point_. Väätäinen coins the term kinecepts_ to refer to the way that movements can be used as analytic tools. She does this to challenge the privileging of concepts in research and ethnography. In short, she is proposing that movement be used as a serious tool in ethnographic and other social research.**

205: Collaborative dance as research.

206: Common notions (called adequate ideas to Spinoza).

207: Affective sociability in ethnography. (Meaning that the ethnographer trusts that the collaborator [previously known as the informant] can engage with and expand many kinds of theories. It means that philosophical, methodological, and research questions can be part of ethnographic encounters, not just academic ones.) 

208: "Kinecepts" (Movements used as analytical tools)

210: Use of the phrase "kinetic collaborative theorizing" to mean research though dancing together.

212: "Barier-thetics"

212: "Splintered extension" also 214.

213: Discussion of smooth, striated and the "splintered extension" where dancers feel uncomfortable and resist all directions of motion.

214: Discussion of Spinoza's "composite body:" the adapting of oneself to another to form common notions.

216: Dancing ethnography and the privileging of concepts.

218: She uses the phrase "formation of a body". I am not sure what this means, but it is related to the composite body above.
