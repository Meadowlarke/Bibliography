# Rollefson, J. Griffith. "The 'Robot Voodoo Power' Thesis: Afrofuturism and Anti-Anti-Essentialism from Sun Ra to Kool Keith." *Black Music Research Journal* 28, no. 1 (2008): 83-109.  

83: Alondra Nelson's Afrofuturism listserve.    

#Z: The term "Afrofuturism" was coined by Mark Dery in a set of interviews he did with scholars Tricia Rose and Greg Tate and novelist Samuel Delany about Black artists whose work engaged with uniquely Black takes on futuristic narratives of science and technology.  

84: Legacy of Afrofuturism.  

-: White supremacy.  

85: Sun Ra and "Myth-Science."  

-: Anti-anti-essentialism.  

#Z: There has long been an assosciation of whitness with technology and blackness with magic, *soul*, and all things anti-progress.  

86: "Robot voodo power."  

-: Robot as whitness.  

#Z: Afrofuturism's critical power comes from the racialized tension bewteen future and past, science and myth, robots and voodo.

#Z: Rapper Keith Kool's Juipter-born alter ego's "robot voodoo power" from the piece "Earth People" collapses tropes of white science and black magic onto one another.  

87: W. E. B Du Bois and double conciousness.  

#Z: "The difference between Afrofuturist 'art' and 'scholarship' is often hard to discern."

88: Hypersoul.   

89: Hybridities.  

90: anti-anti-essentialism.  

91: Robot voodo power thesis.  

#Z: Rollefson identifies in Afrofuturism the anti-anti-essentialism proposed by Paul Gilroy in his article "Sounds Authentic: Black Music, Ethnicity, and the Challenge of a 'Changing' Same" where the two primay critical positions regarding Black identity---essentialism and anti-essentialism---are found unsatisfactory. Critiquing Black nationalism as outmoded idiology and rejecting postmodernism as a white idealist project, Gilroy instead poposes "anti-anti-essentialism" which positions Blackness as a cultural category with real meaning.  

#Z: Responding to Paul Gilroy's "anti-anti-essentialism" and locating it within Afrofuturism, Rollefson coins the term the "robot voodoo power thesis"---the strategic and mediating anti-essentialism of Afrofuturism which seeks to lay a groundwork for humanity which is not bound in the ideals of white Enlightenment universality. The robot voodoo power thesis is the continuity between Afrofuturism and anti-anti-essentialism.   

92: Sun Ra and questioning reality.  

93: Sun Ra on the importance of duality. 

#Z: Sun Ra, in his challeges lobbed at reality and history is not arguing that we do away with these things, but instead that they can not alone explain the world. He is saying that we need myth *and* history to explain the past. This is what is expressed in his term "Myth-Sciece."   

-: "Myth-Science," diverse music, and costumery.  

94: Afrofutrist modes of history making.  

-: Danny Davis.  

95: Use of the Moog.  

-: *Space is the Place.*  

96: Ra on the Hypocracy of white universalism.  

97: The Black mad scientist.

98/99: "P-Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up)"
