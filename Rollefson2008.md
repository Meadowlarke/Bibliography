# Rollefson, J. Griffith. "The 'Robot Voodoo Power' Thesis: Afrofuturism and Anti-Anti-Essentialism from Sun Ra to Kool Keith." *Black Music Research Journal* 28, no. 1 (2008): 83-109.  

83: Alondra Nelson's Afrofuturism listserve.    

#Z: The term "Afrofuturism" was coined by Mark Dery in a set of interviews he did with scholars Tricia Rose and Greg Tate and novelist Samuel Delany about Black artists whose work engaged with uniquely Black takes on futuristic narratives of science and technology.  

84: Legacy of Afrofuturism.  

-: White supremacy.  

85: Sun Ra and "Myth-Science."  

-: Anti-anti-essentialism.  

#Z: There has long been an assosciation of whitness with technology and blackness with magic, *soul*, and all things anti-progress.  

86: "Robot voodo power."  

-: Robot as whitness.  

#Z: Afrofuturism's critical power comes from the racialized tension bewteen future and past, science and myth, robots and voodo.

#Z: Rapper Keith Kool's Juipter-born alter ego's "robot voodoo power" from the piece "Earth People" collapses tropes of white science and black magic onto one another.  

87: W. E. B Du Bois and double conciousness.  

#Z: "The difference between Afrofuturist 'art' and 'scholarship' is often hard to discern."

88: Hypersoul.   

89: Hybridities.  

90: anti-anti-essentialism.  

91: Robot voodo power thesis.  

#Z: Rollefson identifies in Afrofuturism the anti-anti-essentialism proposed by Paul Gilroy in his article "Sounds Authentic: Black Music, Ethnicity, and the Challenge of a 'Changing' Same" where the two primay critical positions regarding Black identity---essentialism and anti-essentialism---are found unsatisfactory. Critiquing Black nationalism as outmoded idiology and rejecting postmodernism as a white idealist project, Gilroy instead poposes "anti-anti-essentialism" which positions Blackness as a cultural category with real meaning.  

#Z: Responding to Paul Gilroy's "anti-anti-essentialism" and locating it within Afrofuturism, Rollefson coins the term the "robot voodoo power thesis"---the strategic and mediating anti-essentialism of Afrofuturism which seeks to lay a groundwork for humanity which is not bound in the ideals of white Enlightenment universality. The robot voodoo power thesis is the continuity between Afrofuturism and anti-anti-essentialism.   

92: Sun Ra and questioning reality.  

93: Sun Ra on the importance of duality. 

#Z: Sun Ra, in his challeges lobbed at reality and history is not arguing that we do away with these things, but instead that they can not alone explain the world. He is saying that we need myth *and* history to explain the past. This is what is expressed in his term "Myth-Sciece."   

-: "Myth-Science," diverse music, and costumery.  

94: Afrofutrist modes of history making.  

-: Danny Davis.  

95: Use of the Moog.  

-: *Space is the Place.*  

96: Ra on the Hypocracy of white universalism.  

97: The Black mad scientist.  

98: Black seperatism.  

-: "Hypersoul."  

-: "P-Funk."  

98/99: "P-Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up)"

100: "Heyperfunk."  

-: Kool Keith.  

101: Dr. Octagon's Afrofuturism.  

#Z: The Afrofuturism of Kool Keith and his alter ego Dr. Octagon collapse, in an act of anti-anti-essentialism and the "Robot Voodoo Power" thesis, futuristic white myths upon primitivistic Black ones in order to critique both stereotyped images and the media which present them---Despite its seeming inanity and playfulness.     

101/102: *Black Elvis/Lost in Space.*  

102: Critiques of power.  

103: "Blue Flowers" and the lineage of Black entertainers.  

104: Conclusion.  

#Z: In the context of Kool Keith and Dr. Octagon, Rollefson finds the Afrofuturist in his "Robot Voodoo Power" and the way that it collapses Black superstition and white science fiction onto eachother to reflect the irrationality of each of these visions back onto the universalist and rationalized society which created them and to challenge this society. 

105: Gnarls Barkley.  

-: Fred Moten and the "break."  

106: Commodities speaking, his aunt Hester's scream.  

107: The new emancipatory potential of Afrofuturism.  

#Z: The ultimate goal of Afrofuturism is the formulation of a "new emancipatory potential" which, through anti-ant-essentialism, breaks from the past and the future provided by Black primitivism, essentialism, and ethno-nationaism, or white universality, science fiction, and liberalism. Afrofuturism seeks a place where the polarized visions of racial strife or a race free world [see whiteness] no longer makes sense.
