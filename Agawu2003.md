#### Chapter 3: The Invention of "African Rhythm"

**In this chapter, Agawu looks at the commonly held notion---even among musicologists--that African music is primarily rhythmic, and contains rhythms so foreign to the west as to be incomprehensible. This invention implies that western music is lacking in rhythm and that African music is lacking in harmony or melodic complexity. It suggests that Africa is one cultural body and it leads to research which can ultimately only prove its own wrongheaded assumptions. He makes a special point in the section "Interrogating a Lexical Gap" that the Ewe speaking people do not have a word for rhythm. He points to this fact as a way to stress the way that what we call rhythm isn't its own distinct category to the Ewe, but rather an interconnected, interterstitial, group of phenomena. Regading notation, a big part of Agawu's argument is that African music isn't an anomaly. Systems made specifically for African music in a sense "orientalize" (Australize?) African music and deny it's universality and would silo African music off away from critical musdiscourses or performance by musicians who aren't Africanists by trade. Essentially, a new notation for African music would be disempowering. Additionally, western notation is probably just fine for African music. Stravinsky notated _Rite of Spring_ just fine. The idea that we need a different notation for African music is based off of the erroneous, colonial, assumption that African music is ontologically different. In the end he is advocating that the only way out of epistemic violence is to empower post-colonial African subjects to write about themselves.**
