>**In this book chapter, Hunter does away with the hard categories of public and private music and instead focuses on how the interplay of characteristics of chamber and orchestral music are used by Haydn to comment on the relationships between composer and performer. Her argument is that Haydn was living at a time when the relationship between composer, performer, and audience were changing. His pieces demonstrate these changing views by writing in parts which seem "improvisatory."**
