### Freitas, Roger. "The Eroticism of Emasculation: Confronting the Baroque Body of the Castrato." _The Journal of Musicology_ 20, no. 2 (Spring 2003): 196-249.

>**Whereas other scholars have focused on how the castrato performed heroic roles despite his emasculation, Freitas argues that it was this very deformity that created their role as heroes. Re-analyzing the problem using contemporaneous ideas of sex and gender as described by Thomas Laquerur, Freitas shows that the castrato was considered especially sexually attractive and potent given his nature as an "in between" on the early modern sexual continuum. In this system, men and women were not fundamentally different, rather men were just of a more perfect form for they had more "vital heat." In this time period folktales did abound of men growing breasts and lactating, and women growing beards and penises. The castration of boys in early puberty or sooner preserved their young voices as well as their pre-pubescent androgyny---which was desirable both to men and women. At this time, femininity was associated with sexual appetite and lack of restraint, so the castrato was seen as especially sexually potent. In this essay, Freitas shifts the emphasis off of the nature of the castrato voice, which had been the focus of much of the previous scholarship, and onto his body. He argues that the popularity of the castrato fundamentally comes not from his voice being high and noble, or light and virtuous, but rather from sexual tastes and epistemologies of the early modern era. From a more zoomed out view, what Freitas is arguing is that the castrati can only be understood if we look at them given their sexual liminality in the early modern period.**

202: He lays out his thesis: ideas of sex were different then, which is how we will understand the castrato. The Castrato was not the neutral vessel as hypothesizes by Beth Kowaleski-Wallace and Joseph Roach.

203: Early modern sexuality as per Thomas Laquerur: One sex, men were the more perfect manifestation due to the effects of their "vital heat". These ideas changed in the 18th century with enlightenment when men and women started to be seen as fundamentally different creatures with no middle ground between them.

204: Discussion of sexual orientation and effeminacy: an effeminate man was thought to be too attracted to women.

206: Eroticisation of boys.

210: Pederasty.

213: Desirability of androgyny to women (but they didn't leave much writing on the topic, so we don't know very much)

214: Discussion of their boyish nature.

224: Castrati's relationships with women. (They were thought to be too able to satisfy women, yet unable to produce children, so their marriage would be sinful.)

226: Refutation of the claim that castrati were "impotent."

228: Animal castration studies. (They retain sexual impulses which are in some cases increased.)

232: They thought that women had to orgasm to become impregnated.
