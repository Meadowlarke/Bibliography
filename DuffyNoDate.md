### Duffy, Michelle. 2017. “Listening Assemblages: Re-Soundig Place and Mapping the Affects of Sound” in _Musical Encounters with Deleuze and Guattari_, edited by Pirkko Moisala, Taru Leppänen, Milla Tiainen, and Hanna Väätäinen, 189–203. Bloomsbury Sound Studies. New York: Bloomsbury Academic.

 **Using the _Images of Home_ project as a case study, this paper looks at how the sounding world makes and takes part in the sense of place. Duffy breaks from the older, Schaferian, school of thought wherein the soundscape is a backdrop to everyday life. Instead, Duffy focuses on how the sounding world is a part of and takes part in the creation of place---we are connected to and through it. A similar attitude was taken in the creation of  _Images of Home._ Instead of viewing recorded soundscapes as a representation of space, they were used to create a listening experience open for other individuals to enter.**

189: Sound and power.

190: Emotion and affect.

191: Affects are non- or pre-cognitive. They are not in the body, not connected to it and connect bodies together.

192: This chapter is about how sound constitutes place via an affective and emotional process.

192: _Images of Home_ project

193: _Images of Home_ methodology.

194: "Sound brings into form space, people, and place."

195: Discussion of recorded soundscapes "not as a representation of space", but instead as "an open listening experience" which allows other individuals to enter.

195: Discussion of R. Murray Shaefer. (He backgounds the soundscape to everyday life---treating it like a painted backdrop---and ignores how we are connected to it and through it.)

196: Discussion of assemblage and agencement in Deluze and Guttari.

197: Analysis of _Images of Home._

198: Discussion of the unconscious effects of sound.

199: Note on how listening effects not only the listener, but also what is sounding. Listening enlivens the environment. (Pauline Oliveros)
