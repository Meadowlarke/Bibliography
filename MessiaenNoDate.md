### Messiaen, Oliver. _Quartour pour la fin du temps: V_ 

mm. 3: Piano enters. E major sonority suggests this key.  

mm. 7: Opening melody repeats.  

mm. 12: B7 chord in piano suggests a V in the key of E.  

mm. 13: Deceptive cadence to A (IV). This is the emotional and melodic high point of the beginning of this piece, perhaps of the whole piece.  

mm. 17: Sounds like a new section, there seems to be a II-I cadence to E.  

-: This new section is also marked by a change in the figured bass, things start to get weird with the 6/5  sonority.  

mm. 27: Long, drawn out tension on a Caug5 resolves to E/B, sheparding in the return of the A section. This sectino is interesting becuause it has returned to the same kindof E major space, but every instance of the tonic is in 6/4 inversion, suggesting a cadential motion.
