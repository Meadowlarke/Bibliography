### Milson, John. "The T-Mass: quis scrutatur?." _Early Music_ 46, no. 2 (June 28, 2018).

**This is a book review of Stephanie P. Schagel's edited edition of Masses based on Josquin motets. However, Milson uses this as an opportunity to discuss his discomfort with certain musicological terms used to describe masses such as "parody" and "imitation." (All without dissing Schagel one bit.) He proposes the terms "T-mass" and "T-music" to refer to the transference of material from existing work. Using theory from hip-hop studies, he looks into how we can try to understand how borrowing was understood in the Renaissance.**
