### Johnson, Imani Kai. 2012. “Music Meant to Make You Move: Considering the Aural Kinesthetic.” _Sounding Out!_ (blog). June 18, 2012. [Link](https://soundstudiesblog.com/2012/06/18/music-meant-to-make-you-move-considering-the-aural-kinesthetic/)

>**Pretty short piece, not a whole lot to work off of. She does, however, introduce the intriguing concept of the "aural-kinesthetic." In my own words, the dance reflex.**

Discussion of disco and go-go.

Discussion of "social dance" as defined by Julie Malning: "community as a _result_ of dancing." (emphasis original)

Her focus is on "a visceral, embodied, kinesthetic response to dance music in a particular social space, which is not explicitly directed by the lyrics or a set of moves but by the feel of a song as a whole."

Sound takes up and creates space. The aural kinesthetic is a spatial practice.

Discussion of how hard it is to capture the aural-kinesthetic in prose or recordings.
