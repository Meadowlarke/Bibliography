>**Feld describes the way that he coined the term "acoustemology" after he exhausted the boundaries of the term "anthropology of sound" while doing fieldwork with the Bosavi in the dense jungles of Papua New Guinea. In this essay he descries sound "as a way of knowing" and what this epistemological shift enables within the social sciences. He describes it as a case of "the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house" (p.14) where other, intellectual equipment was needed to tackle the indigenous sound worlds. "The kind of knowing that acoustemology tracks in and through sound and sounding," he says "is always experiential, contextual, fallible, changeable, contingent, emergent, opportune, subjective, constructed, selective." (p.14)**
