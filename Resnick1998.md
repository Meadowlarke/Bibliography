# Resnick, Mitchel. *Turtles, Termites, and Traffic Jams: Explorations in Massively Parallel Microworlds.* Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1998.  

## Forward.  

iv: This book as an "object to think with" rather than an argument.  

iv: Rebutting the "technocratic falacy of education."  

x: "Just a tool falacy."  

-: The development of uses of technology.  

#Z: All new technologies go through the same pattern of development: first they are used to do what is already being done, but in new ways. In time new uses arise, as do new categories of people who use these tools. For example, the first motion pictures were "photographed theatre." in time however, the "movie" emerged along with directors, screen actors and special-effects designers.  

xi: The "decentralized mindset" of Resnick.  

-: The "two way street" of mutual enrichment between education and science.

-: Emergent phenomena.  

14: Cybernetics.  

-: *Chaotic behavior.*  

-: Artificial life.  

#### Decentralized Theories of Self and Mind  

15: Freud's unconscious.  

-: Object relations theory asd "internalization".  

16: Artificial intelegence.  

#### Decentralization in Theories of Knowledge  

17: Constructivism.  

18: The death of the author.

19: The importance of alternative epistemologies.  

## 2: Constructions  

### Consturutionism.  

23: Learning decentrasized systems by designing them.  

-: Seymour Papert's *contsrutionist* approach to learning.  

24: Instructionism.  

#Z: Seymour Papert lays out a dichotomy between the contsrutionist and instructionist approaches to learning and education. Constructionism asserts that learning takes place by in an active process in which people actively construct knowledge from their experiences of the world. Futhermore, new knowledge is most effectively constructed when people are engaged in projects which are personally meaningful.  

#Z: When it comes to improving education, instructionism focuses on new ways that teachers can instruct, whereas contsrutionism focusus on new ways for learners to construct knowledge.   

#Z: "Educators need to design things that allow students to design things."

#### LEGO/LOGO  

25: LEGO/LOGO: A progamable erector set.  

27: The "snapping together" of LOGO commands.  

#Z: (My idea, not Resnick's) The Lifelong Kindergarten and related projects have seemed to focus on education into math and, computers, and the physical sciences. I would like to develop a related way of understanding education in the humanities. How can we design an educational world such that concepts and resources be creatively "snapped together?"   

28: The shortcommings of "hads on" education.  

29: The story of George, LEGO/Logo, and odd numbers.  

#### LEGO, Logo, and (Artificial) Life

31: Using computers to create and explore decentralized systems.  

-: Cellular atometa.  

32: Creatures and colonies.  

33: StarLogo.  

-: Making better turtles.  

-: *Patches.* (Stationary cells.)  

35: Sample experience of StarLogo.  

#### Procedures and Demons  

38: StarLogo procedures.  

40: The demon mechanism.

41: Object oriented languages and parallalism in StarLogo.  

#### Objectiented Programming.  

42: Enthusiasm over object-oriented progamming.  

43: Deciding what is important in a non-expert programming language.  

-: The "revaluation of the concrete."

44: Giving "objecthood" to the environment.  

#### Parallelism  

45: Parallelism in the tech industry vs. in LOGO.  

46: MultiLogo.  

-: Moving from "one to many."  

## 3: Explorations  

49: *Stimulation* rather than *simulation.*  

50: Microworlds.  

#Z: Mitchel Resnick writes that with his programming language StarLogo, the goal was not to simulate particular complex systems in the world, say meteorlogical patterns, but rather to "probe challenge, and disrupt" the way that people think about and experience complex systems more generally.

61: Ant program in StarLogo.  

64: Description of ant experiment outcome.  

### Traffic Jams
