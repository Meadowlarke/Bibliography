# Robinson, Dylan. *Hungry Listening: Resonant Theory for Indigenous Sound Studies.* Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2020. 

## Introduction  

1: R. Murray Schafer's Eurocentric appraisal of Inuit throat singing.

3: Increase in Indigenous participation in art music since the early 90s.  

4: Increased intersection between Indigenous music and classical music.  

6: The problem with "inclusionary music."  

#Z: "Inculisonary music" which is made to include indigenous artists tends to focus on Indigenous content rather than Indigenous structures. It is more about fitting them into classical structures than allowing them control of the venue used.   

7: Recognition, accommodation, and *Red Skin, White Masks.*  

8: Presenting classical music using Indigenous logics.  

#Z: In *Hungry Listening* Robinson proposes that rather than look at Indigenous music through the lens of classical music, as is so commonly done, we look at classical music through Indigenous frameworks. That is, we analyze how it it used as law, medicine, and primary historical documentation, rather than as content or enrichment.  

9: "Indigenous+art music" and resisting "damage-centered" narratives.  

-:Addressing the absence of race in sound studies.

14: Extractivism.  

15: Reorienting the form by which we share knowledge.

-: Sound's perceived lack of subjectivity.  

17: Dismissal of Indigenous voices as angry.    

18: Critical-affective work in music scholarship.  

19: Controversy in musicology.  

-: *brownamsavenger* on white fragility.  

21: Refusal.  

#Z: Robinson proposes we make the distinction between content refusal and structural refusal.  

-: Context-specific practices of indigenous knowledge and resisting Western demands for complete availability of knowledge.  

22: Screen objects and grounded normativity.  

23: Structural refusal.  

24: Blockades.  

-: "Irreconcilable spaces of aboriginality."  

25: Setting off part of the book for only indigenous readers.  

#Z: In an act of structural refusal and establishment of indigenous intellectual sovereignty along the lines of the context-specific practices of of indigenous knowledge, Robinson asks that non-indigenous readers not read a certain section of the introduction to *Hungry Listening,*  but instead reconvene at chapter 1.
