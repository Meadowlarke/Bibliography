### Cimini, Amy. "Vibrating Colors and Silent Bodies. Music, Sound, and Silence in Maurice-Merleau-Ponty's Critique of Dualism." _Contemporary Music Review_ 31, no. 5-6 (2012): 353-370.

**Ponty et. al. reaiterateed mind-body duality but reemphasized the importance of the body. This paper looks at the differences between bodily and tacit knowledge.**

353: Descarts

354: Hermeneutics and Gnostics

That's all that I read...
