### Bokulich, Clare. "Music in the Renaissance Period." Class taught at Washington University in Saint Louis, Fall 2020.
#### Week 1

Nothing to report here.

#### Week 2

Please add page numbers to discussion questions when quoting or citing. Also please bold authors names and don't be afraid to ask straight-forward, factual questions.

Discussion of how to read a scholarly paper.

Demonstration of Josquin Research Project and other sources of scores.

Discussion of borrowing.

How is the mass significant for borrowing?

Why does Meconi call them "art songs?"

Discussion of vocabulary: Mass ordinary, c.f., parody, imitation, so plachet.

#### Week 3

Forme fixe: Rondo, ballade, and one other

Rondo form: ABaAabAB. Uppercase=text and music repeat, lowercase=music repeats with new text.

Dijon song book (beautiful penmanship)

**Fitch, Agricola and the  Rhizome** 

Things fit together is the idea of the rhizome.

He is putting Ockagam into a broader look at the use or lack thereof of c.f. material.

Discussion of meaning of "polyphonic quotation"

Parody Masses tend to be based on motets.

The opposite of rhizomatic is arborescent.

Agricola doesn't fit in the arborescent view.

Josquin Generation: Group of composers who wrote a lot at the end of the 15th century.



**Fitch, Beyond cantus firmus**

The use of only duple mensuration is unusual.

He's using different texture type t shape different subsections of the text.

His question n this chapter is why the model was chosen, yet largely abandoned (158).


#### Week 4

For composer presentation, start with Grove.

**Kirkman**

Mainly looking at contrapuntal elements.

Voice and text relationships in _Misa caput_.

Masses were sponsored in order to reduce the patrons time in purgatory.

When you hear isorhythmic motet think tenor.

#### Week 5:

Milsom:

Interlocks: A contrapuntal reduction. A monophonic fragment made to fit with itself polyphonically. (a) and (c ) in Milsom take the same material and interlock it differently. 

Interlocks were probably not written in the period, but rather conceptualized. In other words, they were aware of them.

The ideal listener knows the model and previous masses based on it.

Reception and creation as non-distinct acts. Composition as a meaningful act of reception.

Mass as remix (Andrew Tubbs said this)

Contrafact: new words for the same melody.

Kirkman:

Variety vs unity: the c.f. was not a unifying device, rather, something from which to build variety. 

It it useful to look for the worth of th mass in other sources, like the material culture of illuminated manuscripts.

How does Kirkman clash with Fallows and the "symphonic" mass? 

Fuck Ambros. Don't read music with emotion, read as an ethnographer.

Why did the Hegelians love Palestrina? He was the earliest composer known for a while. Statuses changed as they started to incorporate earlier composers into the history.

#### Week 6:

Next week bib due for final (look for Kirkman, cultural history of the polyphonic mass and Weyman, crisis of the middle ages)

Week after is midterm presentation

Songs tend to be one-to-one line of text to phrase of song.

15th century songs tend to be composed from scratch, except for re-workings as discussed by Meconi.

A rondeu will always have just one line of text under the descantus and the rest in a footer.

Section mass

Keep a notebook of how you are researching.

#### Week 7:

Now we talk about songs

Alden:

 Comparing chansonniers to poetry anthologies, books of hours, and books of history. (p 20

the readers were nobles interested in mythologizing themselves

Viralei are a much more rare and longer forme fixe. They wouldn't fit on one opening of a chansonnier.

Zazulia:

High-low dichotomy.

Alden and Zazulia are looking atht eh same manuscripts.

Cumming:

Aesthetic shift away from variety toward unity.

Late fifteenth century music gets less complex and more enjoyable.

_Fuga_ specifically refers to repetition.

Different levels of variety in chansons, motets, and Masses.
