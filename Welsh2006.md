Welsh, Fred. *Welsh's Synthesizer Cookbook.* 2006.  

1: Sine waves and sine wave addition.  

-: Creating a sawtooth wave.  

#C: What is the difference in sine wave amplitude needed to make the proper looking sawtooth?

2: Harmonic diagram.  

3: Partials.  

4: Square wave.  

-: Triangle waves.  

-: Additive synthesis.  

-: Subtractive synthesis.  

5: The use of this in actual synthesizers.  

#Z: The sound of waveform comes from the harmonics it is made of, not the shape of the waveform. For this reason, modeling a synthesizer patch to after the waveshape of an acoustic instrument does not often produce the desired results.  
-: Using two oscillators.  

7: Detuning harmonics.  

8: Pulse width diagrams.  

9: Pulse width.  

-: Syncing.  

22: Envelopes.  

24: LFOs.

25: Pulse-width modulation.  

26: Beat effects.  

27: Keyboard expression.  

-: Velocity sensitivity.  

-: Aftertouch.
