### Meconi, Honey. "Art-Song Reworkings: An Overview." _Journal of the Royal Musical Association_ 119, no. 1 (1994): 1-42
 
**This article is a survey of the unique late fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century phenomena of "art song reworkings" in which portions of secular songs were quoted, borrowed, or otherwise used in the creation of new works. Instead of classifying works based off of their treatment of the original material being borrowed (i.e paraphrase, parody, etc.) Meconi focuses on composition families by tracking the original material itself.**

1: Basing classification of Renaissance polyphony on original material, not the technique applied to it.

1: Introductory discussion of the reworking of secular art songs

2: Discussion of composition families.

3: Thesis (She will discuss the chronology and geography of composition families, theories as to why they were written because this is a unique phenomenon)

6: Discussion of the instances when proving connections is difficult.

6: Discussion of why composers chose to base new works on Fortuna Desperata (Musical power, not text.)

14: Importance of Italy in this tradition.

14: Overview of setting techniques.

15: Discussion of manuscripts outside of Italy.

16: Discussion of reasons for the flowering of secular reworkings.

16: Discussion of the motives which may have lead to these works secular reworkings based on Mass sections (17), reworkings reflecting artistic conditions in Italy (21), fulfilling artistic and pedagogical functions (22), modernizations of older pieces, intellectual play with the audience (23), and conscious interplay with other composers.)

25-42: The remainder of this article is appendix.
