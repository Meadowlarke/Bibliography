# Graber, David and David Wengrow. *The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity.* New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2021. 

## Chapter 1: Farwell to Humanity's Childhood

1: Unpacking the question "are humans innately good or bad?"

2: Rousseau and Hobbes.  

3: Telling a different story of humanity than Rousseau and Hobbes.  

5: Social evolution.  

-: The "indigenous critique."  

6: Political implications of the Rousseauean view of history.  

10: Jarred Diamond's Rousseauean current.  

11: Rousseau's thought experiment.

13: Steven Pinker, modern Hobbesian.

-: Pinker on cities.  

14: Ronito 2 vs Ötzi the iceman.  

15: Cherry picking anthropological case studies.  

-: Napoleon Chagnon and the Yanomami.  

16: The "Hobbesian trap."  

18: People who are given the choice between western and indigenous society.  

#Z: Time and time again in the historical record we see people who, given the choice between european life and indigenous american life, chose the later. 

21: Simplification in social theory.  

#Z: The simplification of history into two-dimensional characters is a common practice in social theory in order to make sense of the world and discover new things. However, a problem comes about when after the dsicovery is made, people stick with the simplification (as in Freud, Levi-Straussian structuralism, and Marxism.) This limits our sense of possibility and makes human life needlesly boring.  

22: Trade without a market.  

## Chapter 2: Wicked Liberty   

27: Rousseau, the conversation he was entering.  

29: The enlightenment and colonial encounter.  

30: Intellectual exchange with native americans.  

32: Natural law and the new world.  

#Z: Europeans did not have the concept of inequality until the 17th C., as a result of natural law theory which arose out of questions regarding the moral and legal implications of the conquest of the New World.  

38: Indigenous critiques in New France.  

40: The lack of discussions of equality.  

41: Individual freedom.  

42: Wendat justice.

#Z: In the Wendat justice system, as described by the French  missionary Lallemant, individuals were not held accountable for their crimes, but rather their whole clan would be required to pay restitution. If, say, a Huron killed an Algonquin, the two tribes would meet and determine the number of gifts needed to make amends with the grieving and prevent retaliation. This made it everyone's responsibility to keep their kindred under control.  Lallemant concluded that the system worked quite well.  

44: Equality vs. "equality before the law."  

47: Communism.  

49: Kandiaronk.  

-: Lahontan.  

56: "Equality" mentioned by Kandiaronk.  

-: Schismogenisis.  

#Z: Schismogenisis is a term coined by anthropologist Gegory Bateson to describe the tendency of people to define themselves in contradistinction to others. Over the course of a conversation, a small disagreement leads to parties taking more radical sides than they normally would have, simply in order to differentiate themselves from eachother and show that they completely reject eachother's ideas. Bateson suggested that this process can also become instutitionalized and happen at a cultural level.  

59: *Letters of a Peruvian Woman.*  

-: A. R. Turgot and the basis foor modern views of social evolution.  

63: Rousseau, again, as inspired by Americans.  

66: European vs Indigenous American freedom.  

69: "The myth of the myth of the noble savage."  

73: "The myth of the stupid savage"---what this book is trying to undo.  

75: Destabilizing the term "egalitarian."  

## Chapter 3: Unfreezing the Ice Age  

78: Framing cultural understandings of prehistory.  

80: The myth of mitochondrial eve.  

81: The great diversity of human populations in pre-historic Africa.  

#Z: The diversity of humans in prehistoric Africa is far greater than any diversity that we have now. The great isolation of many human populations, along with the coexistance with smaller-brained, more ape like species such as *Homo naledi* would probably, in the words of Graber and Wengrow "have struck a modern observer as something more akin to a world inhabited by hobbits, giants, and elves than anything we have direct experience of today, or in the more recent past."

82: The ability to draw conclusions from the archaeological record. 

83: Debunking the "human revolution" of 45,000 years ago.  

84: The "sapient paradox."  

86: Humans as political animals.  

#Z: Christopher Bohem, and evolutionary anthropologist, argues that while humans have an instinctual tendency to engage in dominant-submissive behavior---something inherited from our simian ancestors---what makes our societies distinctly human is our ability to chose not to act that way.  

87: Hunter-gatherer burials.  

89: Monumental architecture.  

-: Göbekle Tepe.  

93: Harari's complacency with the myth of the "stupid savage."  

94: Human thought as dialogic, Western philosophy as strange individualistic development.  

#Z: Human thought is inherently dialogic. We spend the majority of our time effectively on autopilot, and neuroscientists tell us that the "window of consciousness" during which we can hold a thought or work out a problem tends be be about 7 seconds on average. However, this is much longer when we are engaged in conversation, in which we can consider the same problem for hours on end. This is why we often try to figure something out for ourselves by imagining we are explaining it to somebody else. We are only fully self concious and self-aware when debating with another. Western philosophy, oddly, started to take the fully rational and self-concious individual as the norm rather than a rare exception at around the same time that it abandoned dialogue as a typical mode of writing.   

97: Paul Rain and eccentricity among the Neur.  

98: Claude Lévi-Strauss.  

99: The chiefs of the Nambikwara.  

101: "Behavioural ecology" and Rousseaueanism.  

102: Explaining lavish burials without social stratification.  

104: Patterns of seasonal congregation for festive labor.  

107: Mauss and Beuchat on the seasonal variations of Inuit social organization.  

#Z: 108: In Franz Boas's work studying the Kwakiutl of Canada's Northwest Coast, he found that hierarchical forms of organization arose in the winter, when wooden palaces were erected and hereditary leaders ruled. In the summer people returned to smaller clan formations and adopted different names, becoming different people in the summer or the winter.  

108: Plains Indians.  

112: Pierre Clastres and chiefs.  

114: Clastres leaving out seasonality.  

115: Losing our political self-consciousness.  

#Z: For most of human history, our ancestors moved regularly between different social arrangements. They created and dismantled hierarchies on a regular basis. One may ask "what are the origins of social inequality," but the real question is "how did we get stuck?" How did we get stuck in a world where hierarchy, dominance, and subservience are seen not as temporary theatre or temporary expediences for a certain task, but instead as inescapable elements of human life and human nature? How have we lost the political self-consciousness which was once so typical to our species and so central to what makes us human? 

116: Festivals of medieval Europe.  

## Chapter 4: Free People, the Origin of Cultures, and the Advent of Private Property  

121: The importance of the ethnographic record.  

#Z: When looking to modern-day indigenous people to help understand the ancient past, it is important not to see them as themselves windows to the past, frozen in time for millennia, but rather to show us possibilities we never could have thought of otherwise, to show that people are actually capable of enacting such possibilities, and that human beings are actually far more interesting than other human beings often imagine. 

122: The lack of discrete bounded societies.  

#Z: Long distance organization is a common enough element of modern indigenous life. A North American 500 years ago could travel from the Great Lakes down to the Louisiana bayous and find members of their own Bear, Elk, or other clan which would be obliged to host and feed them despite speaking languages entirely unrelated to their own. Aboriginal Australians could travel across the continent, among people speaking entirely different languages and still find camps divided into the same totemic moieties that existed at home.  

123: Diminishing number of people travelling. 

#Z: It is difficult to reconstruct how these forms of long-distance organization operated just a few centuries ago, so it is even harder to guess at how it worked 40,000 years ago. However, the striking uniformities of material culture observed by archaeologists across long distances suggest that their societies spanned continents.

#Z: It seems self-evident that advances in technology make the world a smaller, more easily traveled place. This is true in a purely physical sense, and the domestication of the horse and improvements in seafaring obviously made it easier for people to move around. However, increases in population size have actually meant that fewer and fewer people travel. With the passage of time, the scale of social relations does not get bigger, it actually gets smaller. 

-: The beginnings of cuisine.  

125: The beginnings of domination.  

#Z: It is likely that the hardening and multiplication of cultural boundaries starting around 12,000 BC reduced cultural porosity and the ability to reconstruct and re-imagine society.  

126: Defining egalitarian society.  

127: Surplus and hierarchy.  

128: James Woodburn.  

131: Evans-Pritchard and Nuer hierarchy.  

132: Nuer marriage and sexual freedom.  

133: European emphasis on work.  

135: Marshall Sahlins "The Original Affluent Society."  

136: Abundance.  

#Z: Abundance is the situation where one has easy access to everything that they feel they need in order to live a happy and comfortable life. It is not an absolute measure.   

:- Increases in working hours.  

137: Sahlins's data.  

138: Sahlins on foragers.  

#Z: Foraging societies tend to be well aware of the growing cycles of food plants, and consciously choose not to engage in agriculture.  

140: The lack of an "original" way of living.  

141: Poverty point.  

142: 3500 BC: Cities emerge in Eurasia and America.  

#Z: Cities emerged in Eurasia and the Americas at around the same time, roughly 3500 BC.  

-: Material wealth without trade at poverty point.  

145: John E. Clark and the standardized measurement and sacred geometry of pre-Colombian earthworks.  

145: Jōmon in Japan.   

146: Similar monuments in Europe.  

148: How the myth of the infantile simplicity of foraging life is kept alive.  

149: The "Agricultural Argument" and the genocide of indigenous peoples.  

150: Indigenous land management.  

-: Different conceptions of property.  

151: The Calusa in Florida and domination without agriculture.  

152: "Informal fallacy" circular argument.  

153: The "savage slot."  

-: Arguments of geographic "atypicality."  

155: Eurasian crossings to "The New World" 17,000 years ago by boat. 

#Z: It was long thought that humans first arrived to the Americas from Eurasia by the Beringia land bridge some 13,000 years ago. Newer archaeological evidence shows that people traveled in boats along the pacific rim to the coast of Chile by boat 17,000 years ago. There is also evidence of eastward crossings. We only know this now as underwater excavation has become more possible, as rising sea levels submerged these records long ago.    

156: The Natchez and the Natchez Sun (monarch).
