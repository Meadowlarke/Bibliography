# Graber, David and David Wengrow. *The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity.* New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2021. 

## Chapter 1: Farwell to Humanity's Childhood

1: Unpacking the question "are humans innately good or bad?"

2: Rousseau and Hobbes.  

3: Telling a different story of humanity than Rousseau and Hobbes.  

5: Social evolution.  

-: The "indigenous critique."  

6: Political implications of the Rousseauean view of history.  

10: Jarred Diamond's Rousseauean current.  

11: Rousseau's thought experiment.

13: Steven Pinker, modern Hobbesian.

-: Pinker on cities.  

14: Ronito 2 vs Ã–tzi the iceman.  

15: Cherry picking anthropological case studies.  

-: Napoleon Chagnon and the Yanomami.  

16: The "Hobbesian trap."  

18: People who are given the choice between western and indigenous society.  

#Z: Time and time again in the historical record we see people who, given the choice between european life and indigenous american life, chose the later. 

21: Simplification in social theory.  

#Z: The simplification of history into two-dimensional characters is a common practice in social theory in order to make sense of the world and discover new things. However, a problem comes about when after the dsicovery is made, people stick with the simplification (as in Freud, Levi-Straussian structuralism, and Marxism.) This limits our sense of possibility and makes human life needlesly boring.  

22: Trade without a market.  

## Chapter 2: Wicked Liberty   

27: Rousseau, the conversation he was entering.  

29: The enlightenment and colonial encounter.  

30: Intellectual exchange with native americans.  

32: Natural law and the new world.  

#Z: Europeans did not have the concept of inequality until the 17th C., as a result of natural law theory which arose out of questions regarding the moral and legal implications of the conquest of the New World.  

38: Indigenous critiques in New France.  

40: The lack of discussions of equality.  

41: Individual freedom.  

42: Wendat justice.

#Z: In the Wendat justice system, as described by the French  missionary Lallemant, individuals were not held accountable for their crimes, but rather their whole clan would be required to pay restitution. If, say, a Huron killed an Algonquin, the two tribes would meet and determine the number of gifts needed to make amends with the grieving and prevent retaliation. This made it everyone's responsibility to keep their kindred under control.  Lallemant concluded that the system worked quite well.  

44: Equality vs. "equality before the law."  

47: Communism.  

49: Kandiaronk.  

-: Lahontan.  

56: "Equality" mentioned by Kandiaronk.  

-: Schismogenisis.  

#Z: Schismogenisis is a term coined by anthropologist Gegory Bateson to describe the tendency of people to define themselves in contradistinction to others. Over the course of a conversation, a small disagreement leads to parties taking more radical sides than they normally would have, simply in order to differentiate themselves from eachother and show that they completely reject eachother's ideas. Bateson suggested that this process can also become instutitionalized and happen at a cultural level.  

59: *Letters of a Peruvian Woman.*  

-: A. R. Turgot and the basis foor modern views of social evolution.  

63: Rousseau, again, as inspired by Americans.  

66: European vs Indigenous American freedom.  

69: "The myth of the myth of the noble savage."  

73: "The myth of the stupid savage"---what this book is trying to undo.  

75: Destabilizing the term "egalitarian."  

## Chapter 3: Unfreezing the Ice Age  

78: Framing cultural understandings of prehistory.  

80: The myth of mitochondrial eve.  

81: The great diversity of human populations in pre-historic Africa.  

#Z: The diversity of humans in prehistoric Africa is far greater than any diversity that we have now. The great isolation of many human populations, along with the coexistance with smaller-brained, more ape like species such as *Homo naledi* would probably, in the words of Graber and Wengrow "have struck a modern observer as something more akin to a world inhabited by hobbits, giants, and elves than anything we have direct experience of today, or in the more recent past."

82: The ability to draw conclusions from the archaeological record. 

83: Debunking the "human revolution" of 45,000 years ago.  

84: The "sapient paradox."  

86: Humans as political animals.  

#Z: Christopher Bohem, and evolutionary anthropologist, argues that while humans have an instinctual tendency to engage in dominant-submissive behavior---something inherited from our simian ancestors---
