# Graber, David and David Wengrow. *The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity.* New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2021. 

## Chapter 1: Farwell to Humanity's Childhood

1: Unpacking the question "are humans innately good or bad?"

2: Rousseau and Hobbes.  

3: Telling a different story of humanity than Rousseau and Hobbes.  

5: Social evolution.  

-: The "indigenous critique."  

6: Political implications of the Rousseauean view of history.  

10: Jarred Diamond's Rousseauean current.  

11: Rousseau's thought experiment.

13: Steven Pinker, modern Hobbesian.

-: Pinker on cities.  

14: Ronito 2 vs Ötzi the iceman.  

15: Cherry picking anthropological case studies.  

-: Napoleon Chagnon and the Yanomami.  

16: The "Hobbesian trap."  

18: People who are given the choice between western and indigenous society.  

#Z: Time and time again in the historical record we see people who, given the choice between european life and indigenous american life, chose the later. 

21: Simplification in social theory.  

#Z: The simplification of history into two-dimensional characters is a common practice in social theory in order to make sense of the world and discover new things. However, a problem comes about when after the dsicovery is made, people stick with the simplification (as in Freud, Levi-Straussian structuralism, and Marxism.) This limits our sense of possibility and makes human life needlesly boring.  

22: Trade without a market.  

## Chapter 2: Wicked Liberty   

27: Rousseau, the conversation he was entering.  

29: The enlightenment and colonial encounter.  

30: Intellectual exchange with native americans.  

32: Natural law and the new world.  

#Z: Europeans did not have the concept of inequality until the 17th C., as a result of natural law theory which arose out of questions regarding the moral and legal implications of the conquest of the New World.  

38: Indigenous critiques in New France.  

40: The lack of discussions of equality.  

41: Individual freedom.  

42: Wendat justice.

#Z: In the Wendat justice system, as described by the French  missionary Lallemant, individuals were not held accountable for their crimes, but rather their whole clan would be required to pay restitution. If, say, a Huron killed an Algonquin, the two tribes would meet and determine the number of gifts needed to make amends with the grieving and prevent retaliation. This made it everyone's responsibility to keep their kindred under control.  Lallemant concluded that the system worked quite well.  

44: Equality vs. "equality before the law."  

47: Communism.  

49: Kandiaronk.  

-: Lahontan.  

56: "Equality" mentioned by Kandiaronk.  

-: Schismogenisis.  

#Z: Schismogenisis is a term coined by anthropologist Gegory Bateson to describe the tendency of people to define themselves in contradistinction to others. Over the course of a conversation, a small disagreement leads to parties taking more radical sides than they normally would have, simply in order to differentiate themselves from eachother and show that they completely reject eachother's ideas. Bateson suggested that this process can also become instutitionalized and happen at a cultural level.  

59: *Letters of a Peruvian Woman.*  

-: A. R. Turgot and the basis foor modern views of social evolution.  

63: Rousseau, again, as inspired by Americans.  

66: European vs Indigenous American freedom.  

69: "The myth of the myth of the noble savage."  

73: "The myth of the stupid savage"---what this book is trying to undo.  

75: Destabilizing the term "egalitarian."  

## Chapter 3: Unfreezing the Ice Age  

78: Framing cultural understandings of prehistory.  

80: The myth of mitochondrial eve.  

81: The great diversity of human populations in pre-historic Africa.  

#Z: The diversity of humans in prehistoric Africa is far greater than any diversity that we have now. The great isolation of many human populations, along with the coexistance with smaller-brained, more ape like species such as *Homo naledi* would probably, in the words of Graber and Wengrow "have struck a modern observer as something more akin to a world inhabited by hobbits, giants, and elves than anything we have direct experience of today, or in the more recent past."

82: The ability to draw conclusions from the archaeological record. 

83: Debunking the "human revolution" of 45,000 years ago.  

84: The "sapient paradox."  

86: Humans as political animals.  

#Z: Christopher Bohem, and evolutionary anthropologist, argues that while humans have an instinctual tendency to engage in dominant-submissive behavior---something inherited from our simian ancestors---what makes our societies distinctly human is our ability to chose not to act that way.  

87: Hunter-gatherer burials.  

89: Monumental architecture.  

-: Göbekle Tepe.  

93: Harari's complacency with the myth of the "stupid savage."  

94: Human thought as dialogic, Western philosophy as strange individualistic development.  

#Z: Human thought is inherently dialogic. We spend the majority of our time effectively on autopilot, and neuroscientists tell us that the "window of consciousness" during which we can hold a thought or work out a problem tends be be about 7 seconds on average. However, this is much longer when we are engaged in conversation, in which we can consider the same problem for hours on end. This is why we often try to figure something out for ourselves by imagining we are explaining it to somebody else. We are only fully self concious and self-aware when debating with another. Western philosophy, oddly, started to take the fully rational and self-concious individual as the norm rather than a rare exception at around the same time that it abandoned dialogue as a typical mode of writing.   

97: Paul Rain and eccentricity among the Neur.  

98: Claude Lévi-Strauss.  

99: The chiefs of the Nambikwara.  

101: "Behavioural ecology" and Rousseaueanism.  

102: Explaining lavish burials without social stratification.  

104: Patterns of seasonal congregation for festive labor.  

107: Mauss and Beuchat on the seasonal variations of Inuit social organization.  

#Z: 108: In Franz Boas's work studying the Kwakiutl of Canada's Northwest Coast, he found that hierarchical forms of organization arose in the winter, when wooden palaces were erected and hereditary leaders ruled. In the summer people returned to smaller clan formations and adopted different names, becoming different people in the summer or the winter.  

108: Plains Indians.  

112: Pierre Clastres and chiefs.  

114: Clastres leaving out seasonality.  

115: Losing our political self-consciousness.  

#Z: For most of human history, our ancestors moved regularly between different social arrangements. They created and dismantled hierarchies on a regular basis. One may ask "what are the origins of social inequality," but the real question is "how did we get stuck?" How did we get stuck in a world where hierarchy, dominance, and subservience are seen not as temporary theatre or temporary expediences for a certain task, but instead as inescapable elements of human life and human nature? How have we lost the political self-consciousness which was once so typical to our species and so central to what makes us human? 

116: Festivals of medieval Europe.  

## Chapter 4: Free People, the Origin of Cultures, and the Advent of Private Property  

121: The importance of the ethnographic record.  

#Z: When looking to modern-day indigenous people to help understand the ancient past, it is important not to see them as themselves windows to the past, frozen in time for millennia, but rather to show us possibilities we never could have thought of otherwise, to show that people are actually capable of enacting such possibilities, and that human beings are actually far more interesting than other human beings often imagine. 

122: The lack of discrete bounded societies.  

#Z: Long distance organization is a common enough element of modern indigenous life. A North American 500 years ago could travel from the Great Lakes down to the Louisiana bayous and find members of their own Bear, Elk, or other clan which would be obliged to host and feed them despite speaking languages entirely unrelated to their own. Aboriginal Australians could travel across the continent, among people speaking entirely different languages and still find camps divided into the same totemic moieties that existed at home.  

123: Diminishing number of people travelling. 

#Z: It is difficult to reconstruct how these forms of long-distance organization operated just a few centuries ago, so it is even harder to guess at how it worked 40,000 years ago. However, the striking uniformities of material culture observed by archaeologists across long distances suggest that their societies spanned continents.

#Z: It seems self-evident that advances in technology make the world a smaller, more easily traveled place. This is true in a purely physical sense, and the domestication of the horse and improvements in seafaring obviously made it easier for people to move around. However, increases in population size have actually meant that fewer and fewer people travel. With the passage of time, the scale of social relations does not get bigger, it actually gets smaller. 

-: The beginnings of cuisine.  

125: The beginnings of domination.  

#Z: It is likely that the hardening and multiplication of cultural boundaries starting around 12,000 BC reduced cultural porosity and the ability to reconstruct and re-imagine society.  

126: Defining egalitarian society.  

127: Surplus and hierarchy.  

128: James Woodburn.  

131: Evans-Pritchard and Nuer hierarchy.  

132: Nuer marriage and sexual freedom.  

133: European emphasis on work.  

135: Marshall Sahlins "The Original Affluent Society."  

136: Abundance.  

#Z: Abundance is the situation where one has easy access to everything that they feel they need in order to live a happy and comfortable life. It is not an absolute measure.   

:- Increases in working hours.  

137: Sahlins's data.  

138: Sahlins on foragers.  

#Z: Foraging societies tend to be well aware of the growing cycles of food plants, and consciously choose not to engage in agriculture.  

140: The lack of an "original" way of living.  

141: Poverty point.  

142: 3500 BC: Cities emerge in Eurasia and America.  

#Z: Cities emerged in Eurasia and the Americas at around the same time, roughly 3500 BC.  

-: Material wealth without trade at poverty point.  

145: John E. Clark and the standardized measurement and sacred geometry of pre-Colombian earthworks.  

145: Jōmon in Japan.   

146: Similar monuments in Europe.  

148: How the myth of the infantile simplicity of foraging life is kept alive.  

149: The "Agricultural Argument" and the genocide of indigenous peoples.  

150: Indigenous land management.  

-: Different conceptions of property.  

151: The Calusa in Florida and domination without agriculture.  

152: "Informal fallacy" circular argument.  

153: The "savage slot."  

-: Arguments of geographic "atypicality."  

155: Eurasian crossings to "The New World" 17,000 years ago by boat. 

#Z: It was long thought that humans first arrived to the Americas from Eurasia by the Beringia land bridge some 13,000 years ago. Newer archaeological evidence shows that people traveled in boats along the pacific rim to the coast of Chile by boat 17,000 years ago. There is also evidence of eastward crossings. We only know this now as underwater excavation has become more possible, as rising sea levels submerged these records long ago.    

156: The Natchez and the Natchez Sun (monarch).  

157: Sacred places and the formation of private property.   

159:

#Z: Private property is a form of sacred "tabu" where an object can not be touched except by those initiated as the owner. Graeber and Wengrow trace the origins of private property, hierarchy, and domination directly to the sacred.  

160: Examples of sacred property in Native American societies.  

161: Roman property laws.  

## Chapter 5: Many Seasons Ago

164: Heterogenaity among Indigenous American food production and social orgaization.  

165: The anti-agrcultural natue of Indigenous California. 

#Z: The Indigenous people of California have been used by archaeologists as a model for what the prehistorical inhabitants of the Fertie Cresent might have lived like before domesticating wheat and barley 10,000 years ago. However, Indigenous Californians would have obviously noticed their southwestern neighbors cultivation of food crops such as maize. The indigenous people of California were not pre-agricultural, but rather, anti-agricultural. 

166: Finding reason for cultural diffeerentiation in schismogenisis.  

167: Finding reason for differentiation in cultural drift.  

168: Language families and lack of correlation with culture.  

#: In the Americas, there was little correlation between culture and language families. Groups living near eachotherm but speaking completely different languages would often have much more in common than distant groups which spoke languages of closer linguistic lineage.   

170: Debunking the idea of "cultural areas."  

171: Franz Boas's work on "cultural areas."  

172: Cataloging games and cultural trait clusters.  

173: Marcel Mauss on the notion of "cultural areas."  

174: Mauss on the resistance to adoption of neighboring culture.   

177: Ownership of slaves by some Californian groups.   

-: The use of money by the Yurok.  

#Z: European settlers projected their own category of "money" onto many Indigenous American objects which looked like money, but were not. For example, *wampum,* which was eventually used as a currency in the American Northeast by settlers and was considered legal tender in the shops of New York and Massachusetts, was almost never used by Indigenous people to by or sell anything, but instead to pay fines and as a way of forming and remembering compacts and agreements. Something used a lot like Euopean money did exist among the northwestern Calnifornians, however.   

178: Max Weber.  

#Z: Capitalism, as Weber deifned it, is a moral imperitive to turn your money into an engine for creating even more wealth. Wealthy merchants existed almost everywhere, certainly in China, India, and the Islamic world. However, in these places, one would eventually use their money to enjoy life, or come under the moral pressure of their community to spend their wealth on public or religious works, or popular festivals. The first capitalist, then, would have had to defy all social expectations and be hated by all of their neighbors. Weber argues that it took a Puritanical strain of Christianity, like Calvinism, to make cultural space for Capitalism to catch on. Not only did Puritans believe that basically anything they could spend their money on was sinful, they had each other as a moral community whose support would allow them to endure the the hostility of their neighbors.  

179: Private property among the Yurok.  
 
181: The puritanical culture of Yurok men.  

182: Northest Coast societes and the *potlach.*  

184: Differences in ritual redistrobution, Californian versus Northwestern.  

185: Slaves on the Northwest Coast.  

187: Defining slavery.   

188: The diversity of Amerinidan so-called "capturing societies."  

#Z: Slavery in certain contexts, perticulalry those of the Indgenous Americas, can be seen as the theft of the years of caring labor that it took to produce a work-capable human.  

189: Amerindian slavery, more descriptions.  

#Z: In Amazonian slave capturing, captives would ungo social death though the severing of all their ties with their former group ad would be re-socialized as Amazonain. If the socialization was completed they would no longer be slaves. However, there were some captives kept permanently in social death before they were sacrificed and sometimes eaten.  

191: Violence trasformed into care, the origin of domination.  

#Z: Most of the names traditionally applied to Inidgenous American populations by Europeans are derogatory terms used by neighboring populations. For example "Eskimo" means "people who don't cook their fish" and "Iriquois" comes from an Algonkian term meaning "viscious killer."   

192: "The Story of the Wogies."  

194: "Optimal foraging theory."  

197: Debunking some optimal foraging theory ideas.  

198: The Northwest, fish gathering, and the perrenial shortage of *contrallable* labor.  

199: Slavery in the Pacific "Shatter Zone."  

200: Differences in ideas of the virtue of labor between the Yurok and Northwestern peoples.  

#Z: Yurok victors in battle were required to pay restitution for each life taken at the same rate they would pay if they were guilty of murder. This made inter-group rading fiscally pointless. Millitary advantage was a liability to the winning side. 

203: Rejection of slavery by Californians.  

205: Rejecting environmental determinism and the determinism of structuralism.  

#Z: Graeber and Wengrow make a beautiful criticism of structuralism in *The Dawn of Everything* where they point out that it is an ultimately completely deterministic philosophy. We will endlessly repeat the patterns of behavior handed to us by society: "Language speaks us." There is no explanation for why any culture is the way it is, any more than there is a reason why Chinese is a tonal language and Finnish is an agglutinative one. Graeber and Wengrow prefer to see people in the past as full humans capable of political introspection.  

208: Slavery as a fundamentally domestic institution.  

-: Hierarchy and equality emerging together historically as compliments to one-another.  

## Chapter 6: Gardens of Adonis

210: Plato on the origins of farming.  

-: Woman's fertility cult of Ancient Athens.  

-: Gardens of Adonis.  

211: Destabilizing ideas on the reasons for argiculture.  

212: Çatahöyük.  

213: Archeaologists's tendency to read any image of a woman as a fertility goddess, rather than a barbie doll.   

214: "Primitive Martriarchy" as an academic no-go zone.  

216: Marija Gimbutas, Lithuanian-American archaeologist.  

-: Gimbutas's "Old Europe."  

217: *Kurgan* cattle-keeping peoples.  

-: Gimbutas's work being dragged through the mud.  

218: New analyses of ancient DNA supporting Gimbutas's conclusions.  

219: Defining matriarchy.  

220: Female figurines of Çatahöyük.  

221: The lack of portable depicitions of male forms at Çatahöyük.  

-: Households and millenia-long household routines at Çatahöyük.  

222: Was Çatahöyük egalitarian?  

-: Lack of depictions of agriculture, only depictions of hunting.  

223: The seasonality of food procurement at Çatahöyük.  

224: Seasonal variations of social structure.  

225: Defining and unpacking the "Fertile Crescent."  

226: Trade between the upland and lowland fertile crescents.  

229: Domestication.  

231: Wheat and barley. 

232: Experiments with wild wheat in the 1980s.  

#Z: Under experimental conditions, it has been found that the genetic mutations leading to crop domestication can be achieved in as little as 20, and no more than 200 years, using simple harvesting techniques such as cutting or uprooting.  

#Z: Humans first cultivated wild grasses not for grains, but for straw. Changes to the nature of the grain were likely a byproduct of harvesting methods which created straw from grass.  

233/234: "Pre-domestication cultivation."  

234: Avoiding domesticaiton.  

#Z: The cultivation of wild cereals dates back to at least 10,000 BC, but domestication was not completed until about 7,000 BC. That is 3,000 years to complete a process that we know could have been done in 20--200 years. This implies that humans purposely avoided serious cultivation of grains and the added work that domesticated cultivars would have required---work that would have gotten in the way of hunting, marriages, masquerades, story telling, travelling, or any number other things we know early neolithic people were engaged in. What we call the "Agricultural Revolution" was a period of human history in its own right, barely a revolution at all, where people flirted and experimented with various levels of plant cultivation. . 

235: "Flood retreat" cultivation, lack of icentive for private property.  

237: The erasure of the contributions of women to plant-based knowledge.  

238: Problematizing the term "agriculture."  

239: Neolithic cultivation as laboratory.   

#Z: Amazing quote from Graeber and Wengrow on neolitic scientists: "Part of the difficulty with studying scientific innovation in prehistory is that we have to imagine a world without laboratories; or rather, a world in which laboratories are potentially everywhere and anywhere."

240: Lévi-Strauss on the "science of the concrete."  

-: Mathematical notation in clay, clay as a model of relationships.   

241: Populations in the upland crescent.   

242: Göbekle Tepe, revisited.  

-: Images of male wild animals and decapitated humans at Göbekle Tepe.  

243: "House of Skulls."  

244: Recap of neolithinc farming.  

246: "Skull portraits."  

247: David Clarke.  

## Chapter 7: The Ecology of Freedom  

250: Systems of periodic land redistrobution.
