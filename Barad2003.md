### Barad, Karen. "Posthuamist Performativity: Toward and Understanding of How Matter Comes to Matter." _Sigmus: Journal of Women in Culture and Society_ 28, no. 3 (2003).

In this essay, Barad argues against constructivist or representionalist viewpoints, but rather towads an "agential realist" view based on the non-Cartesian epistemoplogy of physicist Niels Bohr. In this viewpoint, matter is not created by culture, languge, or human observation (which would priveledge language and mind over matter) but it is "always already an ongoing historicity." On the other side of things, there is no such thing as the objective observer who exists outside of the interactions which they are observing. Instead, the viewer is themself a phenomenon of all of the ongoing "intra-actions" of agentially seperate phenomena. She proposes "onto-epistem-ology:" the study of practices of knowing inside of the phenomenon of being.
