### Kirkman, Andrew. "The Invention of the Cyclic Mass." _Journal of the American Musicological Society_ 54, no. 1 (Spring 2001): 1-47.


**In this article, Kirkman makes a critical intervention into the commonly held belief of the historical importance of the "cyclic Mass" as a watershed moment in the history of western music and as a marker of the arrival of a Renaissance of music. This idea is expressed by Manfred Bukofzer, who Kirkman quotes to begin this article. In this paper Kirkman looks for the origins of this perception and compare them to contemporaneous conceptions of music. To find track these conceptions Kirkman begins with Tinctoris in the 1470s for a contemporaneous view and compares him to the enlightenment philosophers and their Hegelian ideologies of organicism and liberation.**
