### Jones, Alisha. "'I Am Delivert!': The Pentecostal Altar Call and Vocalizing Black Men's Testimonies of Deliverance from Homosexuality." Online lecture presented by Washington University in St. Louis, October 9, 2020.

**She reads these acts as performances (which maybe we don't need to take seriously.**

This talk is made from chapter 1 of her book _Flaming?._

Donnie McClurkin: a gospel singer who was "delivered" from his homosexuality. He is an "ex-gay."

She is investigating the social contradictions of deliverance from homosexuality.

Deliverance traditionally referes to a release from physical or spiritual ailments.

Discussion of Men's vs women's descriptions of deliverance. It tends that women's deliverance is not spoken about because it is not found to be remarkable.

Daryl Coley: gay and diabetic. He was cured which launched him into a life of music.

Jones did a linguistic analysis of Coley's singing, noting his use of rolled rs as proof that he is no longer gay. The thought is that an afflicted man could not speak in tongues.

Deliverance is a euphemism for orgasm.

Problematic sermon at COGIC: Menstruation as punishment and affliction, "I'm not gay no more" guy Andrew Caldwell.

It was suggested by some that Caldwell was paid or planted? He used conspicuous hyperpluralization "mens" and "womens." 

It is thought that manner of speach can be used to determine queerness and affliction.

Phrase "love the sinner, hate the sin."

Africans as "the lady of the races" by 19th C. European racial theory.

Sexual assault among black man in the slaveocracy.

Counter-deliverence: radical self-acceptance.

Using the term "biblical literalist," not the derogatory "fundamentalist."
