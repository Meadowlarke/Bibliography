mm. 23: Second theme begins anfter medial caesura.   

There are lots of places you could put the beginning of the closing section. However:

mm. 46: Elided cadence.  

Around the last part of the exposition, the cadences get closer and closer together in the process of closure.

mm. 71: Cadence on Fm, unexpected.  

mm. 79: Gm.

mm 87: Retransition.
