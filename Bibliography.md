##### Abels, Birgit.  "Music, Affect and Atmospheres: Meaning and Meaningfulness in Palauan Omengeredakl."  _The International Journal of Traditional Arts,_ no. 2. (2018).

>**This paper is an exploration of traditional Palauan _omengeredakl_ singing and the concept of atmosphere. In an attempt to sever the connection of affect with atmospheres in some recent scholarship, the author establishes the difference between the non-dualistic terms meaning and _meaningfulness_ and uses these analyze omengeredakl and its "power". Her research makes use of spectral analyses to find meaning in power _in between_ the vocal parts (9) and beyond the music itself**

##### Agawu, Kofi _Representing African Music: Postcolonial Notes, Queries, Positions._ New York: Routledge, 2003.

###### Chapter 3: The Invention of "African Rhythm"

> **In this chapter, Agawu looks at the commonly held notion---even among musicologists--that African music is primarily rhythmic, and contains rhythms so foreign to the west as to be incomprehensible. This invention implies that western music is lacking in rhythm and that African music is lacking in harmony or melodic complexity. It suggests that Africa is one cultural body and it leads to research which can ultimately only prove its own wrongheaded assumptions. He makes a special point in the section "Interrogating a Lexical Gap" that the Ewe speaking people do not have a word for rhythm. He points to this fact as a way to stress the way that what we call rhythm isn't its own distinct category to the Ewe, but rather an interconnected, interterstitial, group of phenomena. Regading notation, a big part of Agawu's argument is that African music isn't an anomaly. Systems made specifically for African music in a sense "orientalize" (Australize?) African music and deny it's universality and would silo African music off away from critical musdiscourses or performance by musicians who aren't Africanists by trade. Essentially, a new notation for African music would be disempowering. Additionally, western notation is probably just fine for African music. Stravinsky notated _Rite of Spring_ just fine. The idea that we need a different notation for African music is based off of the erroneous, colonial, assumption that African music is ontologically different. In the end he is advocating that the only way out of epistemic violence is to empower post-colonial African subjects to write about themselves.**

##### Barad, Karen. "Posthuamist Performativity: Toward and Understanding of How Matter Comes to Matter." _Sigmus: Journal of Women in Culture and Society_ 28, no. 3 (2003).

In this essay, Barad argues against constructivist or representionalist viewpoints, but rather towads an "agential realist" view based on the non-Cartesian epistemoplogy of physicist Niels Bohr. In this viewpoint, matter is not created by culture, languge, or human observation (which would priveledge language and mind over matter) but it is "always already an ongoing historicity." On the other side of things, there is no such thing as the objective observer who exists outside of the interactions which they are observing. Instead, the viewer is themself a phenomenon of all of the ongoing "intra-actions" of agentially seperate phenomena. She proposes "onto-epistem-ology:" the study of practices of knowing inside of the phenomenon of being.

##### Blake, David. "Musicological Omnivory in the Neoliberal University." _The Journal of Musicology_ 34, no. 3 (2017): 319-353.  

**Basically, the argument here is that authors and neo-liberal institutions have been attacking a lack of diversity and so on which doesn't actually exist in contemporary musicology. In so doing, they paint musicology as a burdensom and hegemonic field. Blake argues that we should instead reframe musicology as ain inclusive field. What Blake is trying to show is that there is this norm in musicological research of omnivory. You are not being radical. Omniverous musicologists are not renegades, but rather just taking part in the omniverous turn.

##### Bloxam, M. Jennifer. "'I have never seen your equal': Agricola, the Virgin, and the Creed." _Early Music_ 34, no. 3 (2006): 391-407.  

Bloxam uses the story of the singing white hart at the feast of the pheasent to point to the  emphatic spiritual content of the chanson _Je ne vis onques la pareille_. This is apparent 1) by its appearance at this fest on the cusp of Crusade, and 2) because it was sung in duet between a boy and a white hart---a symbol of Jesus Christ. Bloxam then tracks the proliferation of the line _Je ne vis onques la pareille_---I have never seen your equal---through numerous other poems of the time. Bloxam srgues that this line shows how this secular poetry was in fact simultaneously engaged in spiritual desire and devotion for the Virgin Mary. This, in turn, made it relatively easy for composers to turn this chanson for T-mass material. The remainder of this paper is an alaysis of Agricola's use of this chanson in sacred writing, and how he musically highlihghts the Marian elements in two Credo settings.

> Discussion of how to read a scholarly paper.

> Demonstration of Josquin Research Project and other sources of scores.

> Discussion of borrowing.

> How is the mass significant for borrowing?

> Why does Meconi call them "art songs?"

> Discussion of vocabulary: Mass ordinary, c.f., parody, imitation, so plachet.

###### Week 3

> Forme fixe: Rondo, ballade, and one other

> Rondo form: ABaAabAB. Uppercase=text and music repeat, lowercase=music repeats with new text.

> Dijon song book (beautiful penmanship)

> **Fitch, Agricola and the  Rhizome** 

> Things fit together is the idea of the rhizome.

> He is putting Ockagam into a broader look at the use or lack thereof of c.f. material.

> Discussion of meaning of "polyphonic quotation"

> Parody Masses tend to be based on motets.

> The opposite of rhizomatic is arborescent.

> Agricola doesn't fit in the arborescent view.

> Josquin Generation: Group of composers who wrote a lot at the end of the 15th century.



> **Fitch, Beyond cantus firmus**

> The use of only duple mensuration is unusual.

> He's using different texture type t shape different subsections of the text.

> His question n this chapter is why the model was chosen, yet largely abandoned (158).


###### Week 4

> For composer presentation, start with Grove.

> **Kirkman **

> Mainly looking at contrapuntal elements.

> Voice and text relationships in _Misa caput_.

> Masses were sponsored in order to reduce the patrons time in purgatory.

> When you hear isorhythmic motet think tenor.

###### Week 5:

> Milsom:

> Interlocks: A contrapuntal reduction. A monophonic fragment made to fit with itself polyphonically. (a) and (c ) in Milsom take the same material and interlock it differently. 

> Interlocks were probably not written in the period, but rather conceptualized. In other words, they were aware of them.

> The ideal listener knows the model and previous masses based on it.

> Reception and creation as non-distinct acts. Composition as a meaningful act of reception.

> Mass as remix (Andrew Tubbs said this)

> Contrafact: new words for the same melody.

> Kirkman:

> Variety vs unity: the c.f. was not a unifying device, rather, something from which to build variety. 

> It it useful to look for the worth of th mass in other sources, like the material culture of illuminated manuscripts.

> How does Kirkman clash with Fallows and the "symphonic" mass? 

> Fuck Ambros. Don't read music with emotion, read as an ethnographer.

> Why did the Hegelians love Palestrina? He was the earliest composer known for a while. Statuses changed as they started to incorporate earlier composers into the history.

###### Week 6:

> Next week bib due for final (look for Kirkman, cultural history of the polyphonic mass and Weyman, crisis of the middle ages)

> Week after is midterm presentation

> Songs tend to be one-to-one line of text to phrase of song.

> 15th century songs tend to be composed from scratch, except for re-workings as discussed by Meconi.

> High-low dichotomy.

> Alden and Zazulia are looking atht eh same manuscripts.

> Cumming:

> Aesthetic shift away from variety toward unity.

> Late fifteenth century music gets less complex and more enjoyable.

> _Fuga_ specifically refers to repetition.

mm. 320: Striking moment of hypermetric revelation. Change to dotted quarters in 6/8, 1st violin.  

mm. 334-340(end): Overt recapitulation of A


In this piece I hear a lot of immitation. It's kindof pusedo canonic.  


The development section seems to be some kind of cyclic exploration of the little themes from the exposition. It spends more time with each of them, the structure is longer than the 2 and 2 of the A section.  I think that it doesn't quote from the first opening theme, tho.


Canon-like texture at H.

##### Duane, Ben. "Analysis 1." Class taught at Washington University in Saint Louis, Fall 2020.
###### Week 1

> Spend lots of time analyzing the scores

> Aug 6 chords

> Sonata form

> Schubert's "purple patch"

> Schubert liked a three key structure, which functions much like the more common two key structure.

###### Week 2:

> **Tuesday**

> Minuet and trio forms.

> Kinds of non-chord tones.

> **Thursday**

> Don Giovani, Il mio tesoro: The passage at 12 is a bit ambiguous. The g on the downbeat happens on a dom7 and doesn't sound like la. However, individual chords can evolve over time [David Lewin, "Music Theory Phenomenology and Modes of Perception."] That is what we have in this case. We are approaching by la and leaving by re. The phrase structure of this piece is very flexible and based on the text (phrase labels were invented for instrumental music). The new phrase at 19 is bracketed off by the sequence and key change. It has a small, nested sentence structure. It is lead into by the dissolution of energy via the triplets at 18.

> The trick with modulations is to analyze in both keys and look for the moment when the chords stop making sense in the old key.:

> Bb: I V7/V V42/V V6 vi6(weird) 

> F: IV V7 V64 I6 ii6 V644-753 I

> Sentence: Basic idea, basic idea, continuation, cadence. (Think Ludwig van Beethoven Symphony No. 5 in C minor, Op. 67 BUM BUM BUM BUM… BUM BUM BUM BUM… bum bum bum bum, bum bum bum bum...)

> Period: Antecedent (a) and half cadence, consequent (a') and perfect authentic cadence.

> Small ternary: a, b, a' (but often more varied)

> Discussion of Caplin: Harmony unfolds in the bigger phrase more than moment to moment. He begins cadential progressions at the I6. Remember the sequences of the ascending V6 and descending 3rd (which sometimes alternates root and first inversion).


###### Week 3

> **Tuesday**

> The most important part of analysis is identifying phrases.

> Brahms:

> Hemioa vs. cross rhythm.

> Lots of rhythmic conflict

> a a' b a'' form

> You can have an elided authentic cadence.

> Hybrid phrase type: bi, ci, cont.

> "Tonicized half cadence"

**Thursday**

> Cook (on Schenker):

> Schenker is going out of fashion for many reasons.

> Reduction to most basic structural form is the number one goal.

> Background, middleground, foreground.

> What is the middlegound can be ambiguous.

> Ersatz and earlymean.

> Fundamental line: descending 3rd, 5th, or 8v to tonic.

> Fundamental structure is two-part counterpoint, Ex: e, d, c over c, g, c harmonized I V I.

> Predominants do not, strictly speaking, belong in the background.

> "Unfolding" is basically arpeggiation to which you may add a dissonant passing tone or a neighbor.

> Embellishments may themselves be embellished.

###### Week 4

> Passing 64

> Ascending 2nds in Mozart: 5-6 ascending V sequence + chromatic passing tones.

> Sequences are more about pairs of chords than individuals.

> **Thursday** 

<a name= "Duane, R4"></a>

> Discussion of [Kerman, "How We Got into Analysis, and How to Get out."](#Kerman, Analysis)

> Analysis vs criticism?

> The field of music theory is pretending that it is doing something greater than it really is. It takes a scientistic approach which adds a veneer of objectivism to a fundamentally ideological and aesthetic pursuit. What has been called "analysis" is just another form of criticism. Shchenker was already subjective.

> Instead, Kerman would like to see a willingness to involve aesthetic evaluations.

> Kermans critique of the Schenker Graphs: The f natural at "klinger" is the emotional peak of the piece, but it is left out of the Schenker graph. Schenker also tends to have little to say about the text. 

###### Week 5:

> **Tuesday**

> Bach fantasia:

> seq in bars 9-10: E-F to D-Eb

> Schema theory

> Evaded cadence mm 25.

> Elided cadence mm 28.

> Half cadence mm 33.

> Dominant arrival.

> **Thursday**

> Caplin:

> Formal function: you can hear the funciton, even without reading or listening to the whole piece. "At the needle drop."

> Transitions sound like transitions no matter what.

> Syntax and formal function (17)

> Sentence and period structures and their functions.

###### Week 6

> Mozart Symphony 40:

> mm. 1: theme 1

> mm. 44: Theme 2

> Transition candidates: 20 and 28

> Rothstein:

> What is a phrase 

> Rothstein is a Shenkerian. Phrase has a minddle ground aspect to it.

> Hypermeter: Meter at the bar to bar level---strong and weak bars like strong and weak beats. It is not equal to phrase.

> How can hypermeter be disruptive? Elisions.  

###### Week 7  

Tuesday:

 **Using the _Images of Home_ project as a case study, this paper looks at how the sounding world makes and takes part in the sense of place. Duffy breaks from the older, Schaferian, school of thought wherein the soundscape is a backdrop to everyday life. Instead, Duffy focuses on how the sounding world is a part of and takes part in the creation of place---we are connected to and through it. A similar attitude was taken in the creation of  _Images of Home._ Instead of viewing recorded soundscapes as a representation of space, they were used to create a listening experience open for other individuals to enter.**

>**Feld describes the way that he coined the term "acoustemology" after he exhausted the boundaries of the term "anthropology of sound" while doing fieldwork with the Bosavi in the dense jungles of Papua New Guinea. In this essay he descries sound "as a way of knowing" and what this epistemological shift enables within the social sciences. He describes it as a case of "the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house" (p.14) where other, intellectual equipment was needed to tackle the indigenous sound worlds. "The kind of knowing that acoustemology tracks in and through sound and sounding," he says "is always experiential, contextual, fallible, changeable, contingent, emergent, opportune, subjective, constructed, selective."

##### Freitas, Roger. "The Eroticism of Emasculation: Confronting the Baroque Body of the Castrato." _The Journal of Musicology_ 20, no. 2 (Spring 2003): 196-249.

>**Whereas other scholars have focused on how the castrato performed heroic roles despite his emasculation, Freitas argues that it was this very deformity that created their role as heroes. Re-analyzing the problem using contemporaneous ideas of sex and gender as described by Thomas Laquerur, Freitas shows that the castrato was considered especially sexually attractive and potent given his nature as an "in between" on the early modern sexual continuum. In this system, men and women were not fundamentally different, rather men were just of a more perfect form for they had more "vital heat." In this time period folktales did abound of men growing breasts and lactating, and women growing beards and penises. The castration of boys in early puberty or sooner preserved their young voices as well as their pre-pubescent androgyny---which was desirable both to men and women. At this time, femininity was associated with sexual appetite and lack of restraint, so the castrato was seen as especially sexually potent. In this essay, Freitas shifts the emphasis off of the nature of the castrato voice, which had been the focus of much of the previous scholarship, and onto his body. He argues that the popularity of the castrato fundamentally comes not from his voice being high and noble, or light and virtuous, but rather from sexual tastes and epistemologies of the early modern era. From a more zoomed out view, what Freitas is arguing is that the castrati can only be understood if we look at them given their sexual liminality in the early modern period.**

> p. 203: Early modern sexuality as per Thomas Laquerur: One sex, men were the more perfect manifestation due to the effects of their "vital heat". These ideas changed in the 18th century with enlightenment when men and women started to be seen as fundamentally different creatures with no middle ground between them.

His model, basically, is that affect is transmitted as energy moving toward a more of less stagnant medium, as sound energy moves via compactions and rarefactions.**

> **In this article, Jackson writes an impressive intervention into the way that anthropologists and ethnographers write about the body and culture. Based on his field work with the Kuranko in Sierra Leone, Jackson argues that the body is not an object of society, simply absorbing "techniques," but rather an active participant in the culture. In his words, culture is "practical activity in the man-made environment." To Jackson, culture is created in the body-mind-habitus. The initiation rite of the Kuranko is akin to a Durkheimian koraboree in that it recreates and perpetuates society. Among the Kuranko, the transgressions of, for example, women dressed as men allows one to see the other though the mimetic faculty of the body thus bringing together a reciprocity of viewpoints which continue the social order.**

> **Additionally he argues that assigning semiotic meaning to practices undercuts their meaning as direct expressions. Anthropological analysis, he says, should be consistent with the understandings of the culture at hand. For preliterate societies, these understandings are often embedded in the very practices of theirs which we study. A semiotic analysis (i.e. structuralist) which breaks these acts up into ideas says nothing because the acts themselves never symbolized anything. They just were. Ultimately, he argues that participant observation should be seen as an end in itself and that anthropologists should focus on learning the practical, physical, techniques of the society in order to build an archive of embodied understanding from which interpretations may be made.**

>**In the early modern worldview, _music_ was a much broader category than it is to us moderns. _Music_ encompased elements of mathematics, astronomy, and human physiology.

This paper looks at how Carolus Luython's _Missa super Basim: Caesar Vive_  seeks to aid his impoverished and beleaguered patron, Rudolf II, by writing a Mass which emulates his natal horoscope---the music of instruments being the human controlled analogue of the music of the spheres and able to create an actual effect on humanity.**

This idea is expressed by Manfred Bukofzer, who Kirkman quotes to begin this article. In this paper Kirkman looks for the origins of this perception and compare them to contemporaneous conceptions of music. To find track these conceptions Kirkman begins with Tinctoris in the 1470s for a contemporaneous view and compares him to the enlightenment philosophers and their Hegelian ideologies of organicism and liberation.**

This paper first points out that, through the example of _femme desconfortée_, that the fifteenth century was full of religious imagery in secular places, and that elements like this chanson or dice in this case, could become "sacralized." Long goes to analyze how Josquin used dice in his _Missa Di dadi_ as an alegorical tool for symbolizing various liturgical aspects, as a tool for indicating the canon proportions of the tenor c.f. vs the original, and as a playful bit of "sacrelization" of an toy which has otherwise been associated with sin.

##### Maler, Anabel. "Musical Expression Among Deaf and Hearing Song Singers." In _The Oxford Handbook of Music and Disability Studies,_ edited by Neil William Lerner, Jopseph Nathan Strauss, Blake Howe, and Stephaie Jense-Moulton, 73-91. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016.   

Beginning from the generaly held, erronous cultural assumption that deafness is the antithesis to music making, Anabel Maler writes to deafness as a source of musical ability. Defness, she argues, does not preclude one from musical experience and production, but rather engenders musical ability. Maler describes a four part typology of the four primary types of song-signing perfromance: Live music interpretation services, live performances by song-signing artists, videos featuring original compositions, and those faturing the performance of "covers" or translations of musical works from outside of the deaf community. Maler shows how the styles among hearing and deaf song-signers are divergent. Hearing signers tend to see their performances as accesibilty tools to allow the deaf to appreciate music. Deaf signers, on the other hand, tend to see the visual performance as a space to create a visual and kinetic form of music.

I am largely unfamiliar with the deaf community and I found the two chapters from the edited volume quite eye opening. As far as the Maler chapter, I the examples she chose illustrative of her arguments and productive to read closely. In this conclusion of her chapter, Maler posits that "hearing can even be seen as a disability in the context of Deaf musical performance." This gives me pause, and makes me question the definiton of disability I was reading these chapters with. This feels like a little bit of a throw-away line and maybe I shouldn't take it too seriously, but it implies that disability is in fact just a state of non-normativity. The hearing body is non-normative to the deaf community and so is unable to participate in deaf music making---I definition that I can get behind. What do others make of this statement?

In ending this chapter, Maler suggests that hearing could be seen as a disability

He gives the example that Price Curt Sachs joked that he could spot the gait of a Frenchman or Englishman from some distance. In this piece he spends a good bit of time listing and classifying different techniques of the body and ultimately concludes that it is thanks to society that these ways of using the body exist, and not vice versa. **

###### Intoduction: 

> **This chapter is an overview of the book contents and a brief look at the question of borrowing in renaissance music. There are two kinds of borrowing: parody and imitation. There is also a second dichotomy of covert vs overt borrowing. The renaissance is characterized by overt borrowing and the 19th C. by covert. "Cantus firmus" is a bit of a sloppy term, and some writers prefer "cantus prius factus" to refer to a borrowed melody. At the end of the day, though, what would really be useful is to have an aural canon of renaissance music like we have of standard practice repertoire. Most of the music from this era is still silent on the page. If we could hear it, and be familiar with a body of work, it would be much easier to spot borrowing just by listening.**

She wants us to think of this Mass as the first of certain type of masses, which gave birth to the _L'homme arme_ masses.

390: Puns in the Ballade _Se la face ay pale_.  

395: Blushing and blanching of lover's faces.  

398: Se la face ay pale, associations with Marian worship originate after Du Fay's Mass in Molinet's _auctoritas_.  

399: Bridal mysticism.  

400: Henry Suso's _Horologium_ and the "bidirectional flow" between the sacred and the profane in the Middle ages.  

403-405: The pale or otherwise discolored face of Jesus on the cross and how this relates to _Se la face ay pale._  

408: Poetry on Christ's Passion from fifteenth-century France, survery of, wordplay, similarities to Du Fay's poem.  

409: Robertson concludes that the lover in _Se la face ay pale_ can be equated with Christ, "man of sorrows."  

-: Jesus' pale countenance in paintings of the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries.  

410: Du fay had access to Masaccio's Trinity Fresco and it's depiction of the Trhone of Mercy.  

413: Dufay owned a copy of "The Golden Legend."  

-: Importance of Saint Veronica and the face of Jesus.

420: The Shroud and status of the Savoy Duchy.  

424: Composition of _Se la face ay pale_ for the arrival of the Holy Shroud in Savoy in 1451 or 1452.  

-: Confusion of the Shroud with the cloth of Saint Veronica.  

425: Christologuical numerology and _Se la face ay pale_.  

429: _Se la face ay pale_ as interpreted as christological from the start.  

-: More numerological significances.  

431: Historical context, precident, and lasting impact of Du Fay's _Se la face ay pale_.  

432: Fall of Constantinople and the first _L'Homme armé_ Masses.

##### Sparks, Edgar. _Cantus Firmus in Mass and Motet: 1420–1520_. New York: Da Capo Press, 1975.

> **This book is first and foremost concerned with collecting facts regarding the use of cantus firmi (c.f.) in the renaissance. Until the time of this survey, there had been very little written which systematically investigated how c.f. were actually used in their time. This being an expository book, he saves his criticism regarding how other researchers have analyzed c.f. for the appendix. Sparks presents this book as a tool for better analyzing music of this time period. He argues that the c.f. must be understood in a much broader sense than we understand it today. In its time, it referred to any preexisting melody which is used as the basis of a new composition (not just a series of whole notes, conservative in motion). 3The melody line was not often copied literally, but was more often modified as per the needs of the composer. Pt. one of this book discusses the way that the c.f. was quoted and altered up until 1450. He presents two broad categories of c.f.: structural tenor and melodic paraphrase. It is not his intention to use these terms as systematic classifications, but rather as guiding principles for organization of discussion. He has also taken great pains to transcribe the scores, so please read them as part of the text.(1-4)**

> **In this class session we went over the basics of how the class will look. Then we had a discussion about [Kerman's _Contemplating Music_](#Kerman, 1985) and [Bent's "Fact and Value in Contemporary Scholarship."](#Bent, 1985)**

> "Uncle" Joe Kerman was writing about what kinds of questions musicologists should be studying.

> Examples of positivism to Kerman are producing critical editions, chronologies, and questions of authorship.

> The Bach chronology studies changed how we view Bach as a composer and how his pieces stand alone as individuals. He recycled a lot of material, which brings into question how we look at individual works as individuals.

> Critical musicology, as advocated by Kerman, is interested in what the music meant in its cultural context. (Kerman, _Contemplating Music_. 14)

> Critical musicology is a dialog between context and analysis. Scholars should keep using all of their archaeological tools, but ultimately what we want is a close reading of the music which is informed by historical context and gives historical context for future researchers.

> Kerman essentially wants music criticism to look like literary criticism.

> All of this brings us to meaning and value.

> Bent defends edition making, calling it an act of analysis.

> Kermans view of what is musicology is very narrow. He is oriented only toward the individual "work"

> Discussion of the idea that the composers are  "real men" by their economy.

> Levy is mostly looking at documents made for the public, i.e. textbooks, program nores, concert reviews, etc.

> We need to recognize the history of chamber music as connoisseur's music.

> We need to gt around value judgments by understanding historically why they wrote these things and valued them in their time.

> We need to think about appropriate categories like physicality in "intellectual" music or abundance of thematic material in Mozart rather than economy.

> **Agawu**

> Research needs to begin with the assumption that we are similar in order to see our differences and not Orientalize eachother.

> Agawu points to the idea that rhythm is about the body and harmony about the mind.

> If you are thinking in binary terms you are probably doing violence to the subject.

> Think about the history of dirty deeds of the field.

Context collapse.  

Stafaniak: How does singing the piece give us something which we don't get from a dramatic reading?  



###### Week 12:

What is neoliberalism? A political and economic system or framework about free market capitalism and globalization. All about profit and economic gain, often at the expense of cutting social safety nets. Profit is everything.  

What does Blake think about interdisciplinary research? 

What Blake is trying to show is that there is this norm in musicological research of omnivory. You are not being radical. Omniverous musicologists are not renegades, but rather just taking part in the omniverous turn.  

Dissensus and democratic musicology.  

It is good to point to tJ. Peter Burkholder - "Borrowing" in NG2 he messiness of your topic.  

"Engaged musicology" and/vs "presentist" readings.  

###### Week 13:  

J. Peter Burkholder - "Borrowing" in NG2  

My question for Alex: How does Clara Schumann's relationship with the classics---her acclaim for playing a small number them in the 1830s and shift in the 1840s to playing numerous classics---relate to her performance practices of improvistion, penciling, and other forms of editing and composition within the work? If I recall correctly a lot of the analysis in chapter 3 was on her edits to more recent compositions, such as those by Brahms. Outside of cadenzas, of couse, did she improvise or make edits to the classics? Would that have been acceptable? 

Alex's verbal intro to his book.  

Body and spirit.  

Interiority "not just a keyboard athlete."  

"Being true to the composition" was not what it was about back then. It was about the inner self of the composer or the piece.  

Eduard Hanslick, 1856: "Subordination of her own subjectivity to the intention of the composer" is why Hanslick though that Clara Schumann was such a good performer.  

###### Week 14:  

Redesinging the undergrad music history core.  

Peer review, how does a journal article get published?  

How to get a book published.  

##### Stefaniak, Alex. "Virtuosity." Class taught at Washington University in Saint Louis, Spring 2021.  

####### Tuesday, week 1

VIRTUOSITY 
higher than average ability, particularly technical (but maybe not limited to technique) 
feats your parlor pianist may not be able to replicate 
Is it mostly used to describe musical talent? 
Crescendo of the Virtuoso 
Paul Metzner 
Wider application beyond the arts 
Technically exceptional composition 
"Virtuosity is all about boundaries." 

Def agree re: domestic virtuosos - pick on me all you want 
  
contrast between simple, sparse figuration and fast runs 
trajectory from explaining thoughts to repeated text and music 
trajectory from being lovestruck to having a plan 
Vocal agility through laughter-like melismas 
- on part of both Rossini and vocalist herself. 
medial caesura at top of page 6 - offers opportunity for embellishment 
Coloratura means different things in the aria - from lovestruck to cunning 
JD is not just standing in one place - she's moving around to reflect different qualities 
Exaggerating, widening the leaps - variations that show off her bel canto style. 
Top of p. 6: singer uses virtuosic display to underline specific part of the libretto - emphasizes the "ma." 
Cabaletta

##### Taruskin, Richard."The Poietic Fallacy." _The Musical Times_ 145, no. 1886 (Spring 2004): 7-34.

> **This piece is actually a book review of _Arnold Schoenberg's Journey_ by Allen Shawn,however Taruskin uses it as a platform to make much larger critiques of how we view Schoenberg and classical music. The problem which he points to is the "poietic fallacy"--the idea that the important part of the music is how brilliantly it is constructed, not its aesthetic qualities. He shows how this fallacy arises out of the historiography and philosophy of Franz Brendel. We know that Schoenberg saw himself as part of the Germanic chain of being on its way toward artistic perfection and Taruskin concludes that this outdated esthetic is precisely why Schoenberg is unpopular today.**

> **This chapter details a series collaborative dance sessions by Väätäinen and Anneli Tiilikainen while viewing the film _Point_. Väätäinen coins the term kinecepts_ to refer to the way that movements can be used as analytic tools. She does this to challenge the privileging of concepts in research and ethnography. In short, she is proposing that movement be used as a serious tool in ethnographic and other social research.**

> p. 206: Common notions (called adequate ideas to Spinoza).

> p. 207: Affective sociability in ethnography. (Meaning that the ethnographer trusts that the collaborator [previously known as the informant] can engage with and expand many kinds of theories. It means that philosophical, methodological, and research questions can be part of ethnographic encounters, not just academic ones.)

##### Virtual Dervish Experience.

There are musical clues to end each cycle, to raise and lower arms, and to stop whirling.  

STrange to be aware of both my bedroom and this other space at the same time.  

I chewed on ginger for nausea. 

Music in 4th salute is more rhytmic, feels happier, and more open/comclusive.  

This experience is remeniscent of the way that headphones make the sound come out of your own head. This looks like a halucination.
