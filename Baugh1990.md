# Baugh, Bruce. "Left-Wing Elitism: Adorno on Popular Culture." *Philosophy and Literature,* 14, no. 1, (1990): 65-78.  

65: "Revolutionary vanguard."  

-: Rehash of *The Culture Industry.*  

## Sec 1.  

66: Defining "late capitalism."  

#Z: "Late capitalism" refers to an economy where the concentration of capital has already taken place and the problem becomes finding new consumers such that supply does not exceed demand. Where the worker was first alienated from their labor, they art now also alienated from their needs, drives, and imagination.    

#Z: In late capitalism, the role of adertising is to manufacture the consumer.  

67: The problem with popular art.  

#Z: According to Adorno, the problem with popular art in late stage capitalism is that it masks the alienation inherent to this period by providing diversion and pleasure. This pleasure provides psycological shelter from the truth of alienation and pacifies the masses.   

-: Emancipatory art.  

#Z: Emancipatory art, unlike art for the masses, would bring about the painful experience of being aware of one's own alienation.   

-: #Z: Baugh argues that art which can be enjoyed can also be emancipatory, i.e. reveal alienation.  

## Sec 2:  

68: Representative art, Socialist Realism, and the music of Adorno.  

## Sec 3.  

69: Adorno's emancipation.  

#Z: For Adorno, emancipatory art reawakens the feelings of dissastisfaction and unease, the results of late capitalism, which have been occluded by the entertainment industry, popular art, and advertising. Emancipatory art makes possible the recovery of this "experience of the negative." This accomplishment, however requires that the artwork be difficlt to understand according to normal modes of thought. This difficulty reveals the inadequacy of normal modes of thinking. This opens the mind to new ways of thinking as it reveals the old ways to be lacking. However, because this openning of the mind is revelatory of formerly illusory perception, it leads to anxiety rather than elation. Ultimately, this realization can lead one to try to change their relation to the world by changing the world itself.    

70: Monet.   

71: Inscrutability and the uncanny.  

-: Atonal music.  

#Z: The nagation of consciousness descrybed by Adorno in emancipatory art can be achieved not through the direct negation of standard artisitc practices, which may come across as banaly contrarian, but rather through sheer inscrutability and the creation of an uncanny sensation where the meaning and reaos for the creation of the work are  not immediately attainable.  

#Z: Adorno's ideas of what make a work of art challenging or not are flawed as they ace concerned with essential features of the music, whereas difficulty in truth depends on historically and culturally conditioned habits of perception.   

## Sec 4.  

72: Critiqe of Adorno's critique of popular music.  

73: Adorno's misunderstanding of jazz.  

74: Eric Clapton's "difficult" playing.  

## Sec 5.  

74: The question of creating art for *whom.*  

#Z: Given that the understanding of a piece of work depends on the klowledge and acculturation of the viewer, the question in making emancipatory art is not whether or not to make something difficult, but rather for whom the art will be difficult. In other words, which particular habbits of perception will be subverted.   

-: Class and understanding.  

#Z: One of the problems with Adorno's "difficult" art is that it is necessarily arcane, which requires a certain amount of training to understand. This training requires time outside of productive labor, thus implying a class distinction such that some are able to not produce and live off the labour of others while following intellectual pursuits. In a sense, Adorno's emancipatory art is damned because it requires a bougiose class. 

75: Art which is difficult, yet does not require social hierarchy.  

#Z: The classist implications of Adorno's emancipatory art are the result of the false assumption that difficult art and art for the masses are mutually exclusive.  

76: Problematizing a "trickle-down" emancipation.  

77: Emancipation from within mass culture itself.  

#Z: Responding to Adorno, Baugh argues that, as was seen with the art and music of the 60s, rather than arising from the "trickle down emancipation" from the leftist elite which Adorno and Horkheimer's understanding of art would entail, emancipatory art which can liberate the masses from late capitalism's "mystification" and alienation can arise from--is in fact best created by--mass culture itself.
