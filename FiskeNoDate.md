### Fiske, Alan Page and Tage Shakti Rai. _Virtuous Violence: Hurting and Killing to Create, Sustain, End, and Honor Social Relationships._ Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2015.

**The central agrument of this book is that violence is not immoral, but rather the result of moralization itself. In short, perpetrators of violence almost always see the act as upholding or restoring a moral code in some way. This book stresses that social scientists step back and look at culture without our own moral baggage stating that "moralization is the origional sin of the behavioral sciences." Chapter four of this book contains a subsection on trial by ordeal, though it does little more than describe various forms of the practice.**
