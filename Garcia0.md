### Garcia, Luis-Manuel. 2020. "Feeling the Vibe: Sound, Vibration, and Affective Attunement in Electronic Dance Music Scenes." _Ethnomusicology Forum_ 0 (0): 1â€“19.

**This article seeks to move anthropology beyond culture by bringing affect theory into conversation with ethnomusicology. Using dance music communities as case studies and members as interlocutors, this paper analyzes the ways that affect are tied up in "bass" "vibe" and the collective effervescence of the dance floor. The authors suggest an "affective musicology" which studies how music interacts with actors in a culture and how they make sense of sonic events.**

14: Non-representational theory.

14: Anthropology beyond culture.

15: Affective musicology: how music "happens" (her words, passive voice much?) to actors in a culture and how they make sense of sonic events.
