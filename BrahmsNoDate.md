### Brahms, Piano Quartet no. 2, op 26, Mvt IV.  

mm 352: The dotted eighth-sixteenth rhythm, except in a diminuation such that it appears as x4 r8 x8 x4 r8 x8 r4 etc.

Material often gets recast in a new texture.  

Brahms likes to blur the beginning of the recapitulation.  

mm. 1: P0 theme.

mm. 34: P1 theme.  

mm69: Medial ceasura.  

mm. 70: S theme. This section has a bit of a theme and varioations form.

In this piece I hear a lot of immitation. It's kindof pusedo canonic.

Canon-like texture at H.
