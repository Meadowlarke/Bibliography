**This chapter is an overview of the book contents and a brief look at the question of borrowing in renaissance music. There are two kinds of borrowing: parody and imitation. There is also a second dichotomy of covert vs overt borrowing. The renaissance is characterized by overt borrowing and the 19th C. by covert. "Cantus firmus" is a bit of a sloppy term, and some writers prefer "cantus prius factus" to refer to a borrowed melody. At the end of the day, though, what would really be useful is to have an aural canon of renaissance music like we have of standard practice repertoire. Most of the music from this era is still silent on the page. If we could hear it, and be familiar with a body of work, it would be much easier to spot borrowing just by listening.**

1: Why we study borrowing.

2: Problems with the term "cantus firmus." 

2: Discussion of the need for an aural repertoire.
