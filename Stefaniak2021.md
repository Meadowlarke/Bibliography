### Stefaniak, Alex. "Introduction to Musicological Research." Class taught at Washington University in Saint Louis, Fall 2020.

#### Week 1

**In this class session we went over the basics of how the class will look. Then we had a discussion about [Kerman's _Contemplating Music_](#Kerman, 1985) and [Bent's "Fact and Value in Contemporary Scholarship."](#Bent, 1985)**

"Uncle" Joe Kerman was writing about what kinds of questions musicologists should be studying.

Examples of positivism to Kerman are producing critical editions, chronologies, and questions of authorship.

The Bach chronology studies changed how we view Bach as a composer and how his pieces stand alone as individuals. He recycled a lot of material, which brings into question how we look at individual works as individuals.

Critical musicology, as advocated by Kerman, is interested in what the music meant in its cultural context. (Kerman, _Contemplating Music_. 14)

Critical musicology is a dialog between context and analysis. Scholars should keep using all of their archaeological tools, but ultimately what we want is a close reading of the music which is informed by historical context and gives historical context for future researchers.

Kerman essentially wants music criticism to look like literary criticism.

All of this brings us to meaning and value.

Bent defends edition making, calling it an act of analysis.

Kermans view of what is musicology is very narrow. He is oriented only toward the individual "work"

#### Office Hours, 1T

Casting castrati only makes sense if you take into account Early Modern sexuality.

#### Week 2

Discussion of the anatomy of a scholarly article.

Discussion of Freitas.

Score as script


#### Week 3

**Library tour, example: Rebekah Clarke**

Start with New Grove (not updated frequently). It will give you a bibliography.

JSTOR (Lib>Databases>J)

RILM (Lib>Quicklinks)

Actually browse the library stacks.

Classic Catalog (request=recall)

World Cat (send ILL request to ILLIAD, it will take about 1 week. You can also get PDFs of chapters.)

BEST WAY to get journal articles: Type name of Journal into classic catalog to get institutional subscription

**Levy**

Discussion of the idea that the composers are  "real men" by their economy.

Levy is mostly looking at documents made for the public, i.e. textbooks, program nores, concert reviews, etc.

We need to recognize the history of chamber music as connoisseur's music.

We need to gt around value judgments by understanding historically why they wrote these things and valued them in their time.

We need to think about appropriate categories like physicality in "intellectual" music or abundance of thematic material in Mozart rather than economy.

**Agawu**

Research needs to begin with the assumption that we are similar in order to see our differences and not Orientalize eachother.

Agawu points to the idea that rhythm is about the body and harmony about the mind.

If you are thinking in binary terms you are probably doing violence to the subject.

Think about the history of dirty deeds of the field.

**Taruskin**

There is no such thing as listening to music without a preexistent lens. (No pure, unmediated view. We can't expirience music without mediation, nor could critics nor Schoenberg's audiences.)

Composers can't be where music history ends.

#### Week 4

Discussion of sheet music archive

Jeanine with the light brown hair

Women were the stereo systems of the 19th C.

Bring in other music in project to set up context. You might, for example, look at Stephen Foster's songs as a body. Or see if there were other variation sets of the same theme.

If you don't see a pattern. that can be a thesis.

Henderson calls the music not especially harmonically interesting, but rhythmically active. This is reductionist and boring.

Minstrelsy touched all of American music.

Minstrelsy was popular in the Northeast.

#### Week 5:

Transparency is the gold standard in the humanities. It is like replicability in the sciences. 

#### Week 6: 

Discussion with Dan Fister and Elena.

Westergaard

Jackenof's problem is that the binary tree works for language but not passing tones in music.

Snarenberg learned lot about music cognition though his project WesterParse.

there is no good competing theory of tonal music the Schenkerian analysis.

#### Week 12:

What is neoliberalism? A political and economic system or framework about free market capitalism and globalization. All about profit and economic gain, often at the expense of cutting social safety nets. Profit is everything.  

What does Blake think about interdisciplinary research? 

What Blake is trying to show is that there is this norm in musicological research of omnivory. You are not being radical. Omniverous musicologists are not renegades, but rather just taking part in the omniverous turn.  

Dissensus and democratic musicology.  

It is good to point to tJ. Peter Burkholder - "Borrowing" in NG2 he messiness of your topic.  

"Engaged musicology" and/vs "presentist" readings.  

#### Week 13:  

J. Peter Burkholder - "Borrowing" in NG2  

My question for Alex: How does Clara Schumann's relationship with the classics---her acclaim for playing a small number them in the 1830s and shift in the 1840s to playing numerous classics---relate to her performance practices of improvistion, penciling, and other forms of editing and composition within the work? If I recall correctly a lot of the analysis in chapter 3 was on her edits to more recent compositions, such as those by Brahms. Outside of cadenzas, of couse, did she improvise or make edits to the classics? Would that have been acceptable? 

Alex's verbal intro to his book.  

Body and spirit.  

Interiority "not just a keyboard athlete."  

"Being true to the composition" was not what it was about back then. It was about the inner self of the composer or the piece.  

Eduard Hanslick, 1856: "Subordination of her own subjectivity to the intention of the composer" is why Hanslick though that Clara Schumann was such a good performer.  

#### Week 14:  

Redesinging the undergrad music history core.
