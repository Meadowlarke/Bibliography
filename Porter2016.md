192: *All Things Considered's* debut, covering an anti-war protest.  

194: #Z: *NPR's* *All Things Considered* debuted with the chaotic coverage of what at the time was the biggest anti-Vietnam war protest. It consisted of tape gathered from multiple reporters at the event with no overarching narrative. It was unlike anything of its time. Its chaos was intended to capture the chaos of the moment, but was also part of a larger aesthetic and political trend on the program to hear the voices of normal Americans, which is now recognizable as the "public radir sound." Regarding the debut, Susan Stamberg sad that "There was no interfering narrator."  

194: *All Things Considered* refusing to hire an authoratative varrator.  

-: *NPR* turned down $300,000 from the Ford Foundation as it was attatched to them hiring bradcast journalist Edward P. Morgan as host of *All Things Considered,* who would have brought the young network credibility, fearing that it would get in the way of the alternative voices the program wanted to showcase.
