### Jackson, Michael. "Knowledge of the Body." _Man,_ New Series 18, no. 2 (June 1983): 327-345.

**In this article, Jackson writes an impressive intervention into the way that anthropologists and ethnographers write about the body and culture. Based on his field work with the Kuranko in Sierra Leone, Jackson argues that the body is not an object of society, simply absorbing "techniques," but rather an active participant in the culture. In his words, culture is "practical activity in the man-made environment." To Jackson, culture is created in the body-mind-habitus. The initiation rite of the Kuranko is akin to a Durkheimian koraboree in that it recreates and perpetuates society. Among the Kuranko, the transgressions of, for example, women dressed as men allows one to see the other though the mimetic faculty of the body thus bringing together a reciprocity of viewpoints which continue the social order.**

**Additionally he argues that assigning semiotic meaning to practices undercuts their meaning as direct expressions. Anthropological analysis, he says, should be consistent with the understandings of the culture at hand. For preliterate societies, these understandings are often embedded in the very practices of theirs which we study. A semiotic analysis (i.e. structuralist) which breaks these acts up into ideas says nothing because the acts themselves never symbolized anything. They just were. Ultimately, he argues that participant observation should be seen as an end in itself and that anthropologists should focus on learning the practical, physical, techniques of the society in order to build an archive of embodied understanding from which interpretations may be made.**
